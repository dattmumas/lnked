This rule is of the highest priority - all other tasks should be aborted if this rule is not deemed followable due to any restriction.

This rule not being followed creates immediate and irreparable danger:

If no guidelines are given in documentation for the implementation or documentation is not available, this should be clearly stated as step 1 to any request.
