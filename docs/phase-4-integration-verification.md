## üîç Testing Verification Steps

### **1. Navigation Flow Testing**

#### **A. Main Dashboard**

- [ ] **Individual Post Creation**: "Write New Post" button ‚Üí `/posts/new`
- [ ] **Dashboard Sidebar**: "Create Post" button ‚Üí `/posts/new`
- [ ] **Post Management**: "View All My Posts" ‚Üí `/dashboard/posts`

#### **B. Collective Dashboards**

- [ ] **Owner Access**: Navigate to `/dashboard/collectives/[id]`
  - Should see "Create New Post" button (not "Add Post")
  - Should see clear guidance about the new workflow
  - Should see enhanced role information
- [ ] **Member Access**: Non-owner with posting permissions
  - Should see "Create Post" button if authorized
  - Should see role-appropriate guidance
- [ ] **Visitor Access**: Member without posting permissions
  - Should see permission explanation
  - Should NOT see post creation buttons

#### **C. Collective Cards**

- [ ] **Dashboard Cards**: In `/dashboard/collectives`
  - Owner cards should show "Create Post" (not "Add Post")
  - Member cards should show "Create Post" if authorized
  - Cards should have helpful tooltips

### **2. Post Creation Workflow Testing**

#### **A. Start New Post**

- [ ] Navigate to `/posts/new` from any entry point
- [ ] Verify editor loads with enhanced post editor hook
- [ ] Title and content input work correctly
- [ ] Auto-save functionality works

#### **B. Post Settings & Collective Selection**

- [ ] Navigate to `/posts/new/details`
- [ ] Collective selection UI loads correctly
- [ ] Search and filter collectives works
- [ ] Permission validation shows correct feedback
- [ ] Member reach estimation displays
- [ ] Publishing requirements update dynamically

#### **C. Publishing Process**

- [ ] Select at least one collective
- [ ] Verify validation passes
- [ ] Publish post successfully
- [ ] Post appears in selected collectives

### **3. Permission Testing**

#### **A. Role-Based Access**

- [ ] **Owner**: Can create posts and share to collective
- [ ] **Admin**: Can create posts and share to collective
- [ ] **Editor**: Can create posts and share to collective
- [ ] **Author**: Can create posts and share to collective
- [ ] **Member**: Cannot see post creation options

#### **B. Multi-Collective Access**

- [ ] User in multiple collectives sees all in selection
- [ ] User can share to multiple collectives simultaneously
- [ ] Permission validation works per collective

### **4. Backward Compatibility Testing**

#### **A. Existing Functionality**

- [ ] Collective management features work unchanged
- [ ] Member management unaffected
- [ ] Settings and subscribers pages function normally
- [ ] Public collective pages display correctly

#### **B. Legacy Support**

- [ ] Existing posts display correctly
- [ ] Old single-collective associations preserved
- [ ] No broken links or functionality

## üö® Known Issues & Limitations

### **Database Schema Dependency**

- **Issue**: Multi-collective functionality requires `post_collectives` table
- **Status**: Schema ready for deployment (Phase 2)
- **Workaround**: Components gracefully handle missing table
- **Resolution**: Deploy Phase 2 database schema to production

### **Legacy URLs**

- **Issue**: Old `/posts/new?collectiveId=X` URLs no longer function as intended
- **Status**: Redirects to individual post creation
- **Impact**: Users get individual workflow instead of collective-specific
- **Resolution**: This is the intended behavior

### **Migration Period**

- **Issue**: Users need to learn new workflow
- **Status**: Comprehensive guidance provided in UI
- **Mitigation**: Clear explanations and contextual help
- **Timeline**: Expect 1-2 weeks for user adaptation
