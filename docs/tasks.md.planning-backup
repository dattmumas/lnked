1. Editor Page (“Enter post title… / Publish Settings”)
   A. Layout & Visual Hierarchy
   Excessive White Space Left Panel

Issue: The left panel (“Publish Settings”) occupies a narrow strip of whitespace without a strong visual separation from the main editor area.

Recommendation:

Introduce a subtle background shade (e.g., light gray) or a dividing line to clearly separate the publish­settings panel from the editor.

Increase the left panel’s width to accommodate controls without crowding, or collapse it into a sliding drawer to reclaim empty space.

Floating Toolbar & Empty Canvas

Issue: The rich text toolbar floats mid-page over an otherwise empty canvas. The toolbar feels disconnected from content.

Recommendation:

Pin the toolbar directly above the editing canvas (sticky positioning) so it remains contextually tied to the content area.

Add placeholder text or example prompts (e.g., “Begin writing your story…” in a muted color) to reduce the feeling of emptiness and guide the user into action.

Publish Settings Radio Buttons

Issue: The radio buttons for “Draft,” “Publish,” and “Schedule” lack emphasis. Users may overlook them until they finish writing.

Recommendation:

Convert them into a clear vertical checklist with descriptive icons (e.g., a lock for Draft, globe for Publish, calendar for Schedule).

Apply stronger labels and spacing to prevent accidental misselection (e.g., 12–16px vertical padding between each option).

B. Typography & Readability
Font Sizes & Contrast

Issue: The “Enter post title…” heading is in a relatively small font compared to the toolbar icons. Contrast between placeholder text and background is low.

Recommendation:

Increase the title font size (e.g., from 24px to 30px) and apply a slightly darker shade to the placeholder to improve readability.

Use a consistent font scale (e.g., h1 = 36px, h2 = 28px, body = 16px) to maintain hierarchy.

Toolbar Icon Density

Issue: Too many icons are clustered in the toolbar, resulting in cognitive overload.

Recommendation:

Move less frequently used formatting options (e.g., code block, strikethrough) into an “overflow” menu or dropdown.

Group related controls (e.g., text alignment, lists) under clear sub-menus to streamline the primary toolbar.

C. Interaction Feedback & Affordance
Lack of Visual Affordance on Buttons

Issue: Buttons like “Save Draft” lack hover states or clear affordance to indicate clickability.

Recommendation:

Apply a visible hover state (e.g., darker background on hover) and active state for each button/link.

Ensure focus rings for keyboard navigation are highly visible (e.g., 2px blue outline).

Publish Action Confirmation

Issue: Choosing “Publish” immediately makes it live—no intermediate confirmation.

Recommendation:

Introduce a confirmation modal when switching from “Draft” to “Publish,” verifying the user wants to go live now.

For “Schedule,” require a date + time picker immediately upon selection to prevent incomplete scheduling.

2. Dashboard Overview Page (Metrics + My Content)
   A. Information Architecture & Clarity
   Top Metrics Panel

Issue: Metrics (Subscribers, Followers, Posts, etc.) are displayed in a single row with minimal visual grouping. Users may struggle to parse which data point corresponds to which label at a glance.

Recommendation:

Enclose each metric in a distinct card or bordered box (e.g., 1px light gray border, 8px padding).

Increase spacing between cards (e.g., margin of 16px) so each metric stands out as its own piece of information.

“My Content” Section Labeling

Issue: The “My Content” header appears below an unrelated blank region, causing a disconnect between the headline and content.

Recommendation:

Move “My Content” up so it immediately follows the metrics panel, reducing vertical whitespace.

Add a short descriptive subtext (e.g., “Recent drafts and published posts”) to clarify the section’s purpose.

B. Visual Styling & Consistency
Button Styling (“Write New Post”, “View Profile”)

Issue: Primary call-to-action buttons share the same outline style, making it hard to identify the most important actions.

Recommendation:

Designate a single primary button style (solid fill in brand color) for the most common next step (e.g., “Write New Post”).

Use secondary button styling (outlined or ghost) for less critical actions (e.g., “View Profile”, “Video Management”).

Card/List Item Styling

Issue: The list of posts under “My Content” uses minimal separation—titles sit flush without visual dividers.

Recommendation:

Wrap each post title in a card or list‐group element with a light background hover effect.

Add “Published” badges with a colored background (e.g., green) and adjust the font weight to improve scannability.

C. Navigation & Wayfinding
Left Navigation Highlighting

Issue: It’s not obvious which left-nav item is active—no bolding, highlight bar, or icon change.

Recommendation:

Highlight the current page link (e.g., “Overview”) by increasing font weight and adding a colored vertical bar (4px) to the left.

On hover, subtly change background color (e.g., 2–3% darker shade) to indicate interactivity.

My Owned Collectives Panel

Issue: The “My Owned Collectives” area is visually disconnected from “My Content” and repeats “No Collectives Yet.”

Recommendation:

Collapse empty states into a single section or use tabs (e.g., Content / Collectives) to reduce on-screen noise.

Provide a tooltip or secondary line of text explaining what a “Collective” is to avoid user confusion.

3. Video Management Page
   A. Content Density & Layout
   Empty States & Filtering Toolbar

Issue: The “Library” toolbar (search bar + status filter + sort dropdown) is floating over a mostly blank area, making the page look under-utilized.

Recommendation:

Center the empty state message or “no videos uploaded” illustration if the library is empty to communicate status more clearly.

If videos exist, use a grid layout with responsive cards rather than a single large card, maximizing screen real estate.

Video Card Details

Issue: The “Untitled Video” card shows only “Ready” status and a trash icon. Key metadata is missing (duration, views, upload date).

Recommendation:

Add small metadata lines below the title (e.g., “2:45 | 5 views | Uploaded 5d ago”) in a lighter font.

Include action icons (e.g., edit metadata, view analytics) next to the delete icon so users can manage without leaving the page.

B. Visual Emphasis & Affordance
“Upload Video” & “Go Live” Buttons

Issue: Both buttons share the same visual style, diminishing the hierarchy of their importance.

Recommendation:

Make “Upload Video” the primary action (solid brand color), and “Go Live” as a secondary (outline or ghost).

On hover, apply a slight elevation (box-shadow) to signal pressability.

Library/List View Toggle

Issue: The toggle between “Library” and “Live Streams” is small and easy to overlook.

Recommendation:

Use clearly labeled tabs with a visible underline to denote the active tab.

Increase the tappable/clickable area to at least 44×44px for touch accessibility.

C. Spacing & Responsiveness
Excessive Margins on Right Side

Issue: A large margin or blank area exists on the right, making the content feel off-centered.

Recommendation:

Adjust the grid/container max-width to 1200px and center align the content.

For larger monitors, allow video cards to wrap into multiple columns (e.g., 3–4 cards per row) rather than occupying only 1.

Vertical Scrollbar Visibility

Issue: The scrollbar appears far to the right with no sticky elements, causing users to lose context as they scroll.

Recommendation:

Implement a sticky header for the filter toolbar so it remains visible when scrolling through a long list of videos.

4. “My Posts” (Posts Table) Page
   A. Table Structure & Readability
   Table Borders & Row Separation

Issue: The table uses only thin borders, making rows visually blend together.

Recommendation:

Increase row height to at least 48px and add a light horizontal separator on hover for clearer row delineation.

Bold the header row and give it a distinct background (e.g., light gray) to separate it from data rows.

Icons in “Actions” Column

Issue: Icons (view, edit, pin, delete) are small with minimal spacing; users may misclick.

Recommendation:

Enlarge icons to 24×24px and add 8px horizontal padding between each.

Include hover tooltips or aria-labels (“View Post,” “Edit Post,” “Pin Post,” “Delete Post”) for clarity and accessibility.

B. Functionality & Interactivity
Sorting & Filtering

Issue: The “My Posts” table lacks visible controls for sorting by date, filtering by status, or searching within posts.

Recommendation:

Add a search input above the table (“Search posts…”) and a dropdown to filter by status (Draft / Published).

Make the “Publish Date” and “Likes” columns sortable by clicking the header, with a small arrow indicating sort direction.

Pagination vs. Infinite Scroll

Issue: If the user has many posts, infinite scroll may overwhelm navigation; vice versa, pagination may be omitted.

Recommendation:

Implement pagination controls below the table (e.g., “Prev / 1 2 3 / Next”) if post count exceeds 10.

Alternatively, use infinite scroll with a “Load more” button to let users control content loading.

C. Mobile Responsiveness Considerations
Column Overload on Narrow Screens

Issue: On mobile widths, showing all columns (“Title,” “Status,” “Publish Date,” etc.) may cause horizontal scrolling.

Recommendation:

Collapse less critical columns (e.g., “Likes,” “Actions”) into a chevron (“>”) expandable row.

Prioritize “Title” and “Status” on initial view, with an inline action menu (⋮) to reveal “Edit,” “Delete,” etc.
