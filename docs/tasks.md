Preivous versions of the video upload process had a screen where the video details and settings could be controlled.

I want this reintegrated into the process, the upload screen should remain generally the same (minor alterations can be made).

I am flexible on how this feature is integrated but it should be consistent with theme and design.

The second aspect of this is that I want these integrated with the /home page functionality - so consider the details needed by a card that will be integrated into the feed.
