The current site design distinguishes between posts by collectives, and posts by individuals.

I want to change this to get rid of the ability for collectives to create posts themselves.

Instead, indidual profiles can create posts and post them to collectives. This will need to be customizable for future options around sharing, but this is a redesign to the creation process.

On the new post settings page, their should be an option abotu where the post will actually be shared. A menu should show all the collectives the person is a member of and give the option to post it to multiple.
