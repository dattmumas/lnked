# MUX Webhook Enhancement Summary

## Overview

Enhanced the MUX webhook implementation (`/src/app/api/mux-webhook/route.ts`) to address several critical gaps that were causing "Waiting for playback ID" issues and missing error handling.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Enhanced Error Checking & Validation**

- **Before**: Updates didn't verify if rows were actually modified
- **After**: Added row count validation with detailed logging
- **Impact**: Prevents silent failures when webhook updates don't match any records

### 2. **Fallback Mechanism for Asset Ready Events**

- **Before**: If `mux_asset_id` wasn't set, `video.asset.ready` webhook would fail silently
- **After**: Added fallback to search by `mux_upload_id` when `mux_asset_id` lookup fails
- **Impact**: Handles race conditions where asset creation webhook hasn't run yet

### 3. **Complete Field Mapping**

- **Before**: Missing `processed_at` timestamp and `playback_policy` fields
- **After**: Now sets:
  - `processed_at`: Timestamp when video becomes ready
  - `playback_policy`: MUX playback policy ('public' or 'signed')
  - `mux_playback_id`: Playback ID for streaming
- **Impact**: Proper alignment with database schema and better video state tracking

### 4. **Comprehensive Error Event Handling**

- **Before**: Only handled success events (`video.asset.ready`, `video.upload.asset_created`)
- **After**: Added handlers for all error scenarios:
  - `video.asset.errored`: Processing failures
  - `video.upload.errored`: Upload failures
  - `video.upload.cancelled`: Cancelled uploads
- **Impact**: Videos no longer get stuck in "processing" state when errors occur

## Implementation Details

### New Webhook Handlers

#### `handleAssetErrored()`

- Updates video status to 'errored'
- Stores detailed error information in `error_details` field
- Supports both asset ID and upload ID lookups

#### `handleUploadErrored()`

- Handles upload-specific errors
- Stores error context with upload metadata

#### `handleUploadCancelled()`

- Marks cancelled uploads as errored (preserves audit trail)
- Prevents orphaned "preparing" status records

### Enhanced Existing Handlers

#### `handleAssetReady()` Improvements

- Added fallback mechanism for out-of-order webhooks
- Proper `processed_at` timestamp setting
- Correct `playback_policy` extraction and storage
- Detailed success/failure logging

#### `handleUploadAssetCreated()` Improvements

- Added row count validation
- Better error handling and logging
- Clearer success/failure reporting

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variable

Ensure `MUX_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is properly configured:

```bash
MUX_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_actual_webhook_secret_from_mux
```

### Database Schema Alignment

The webhook now properly utilizes these video_assets fields:

- `status`: 'preparing' | 'processing' | 'ready' | 'errored' | 'deleted'
- `processed_at`: Timestamp when processing completed
- `playback_policy`: 'public' | 'signed'
- `error_details`: JSON object with error information
- `mux_playback_id`: MUX playback ID for streaming

## Testing Considerations

### Webhook Event Types to Test

1. **Normal Flow**: `video.upload.asset_created` → `video.asset.ready`
2. **Out-of-Order Events**: `video.asset.ready` before asset creation
3. **Error Scenarios**: Asset processing failures, upload errors
4. **Edge Cases**: Cancelled uploads, network timeouts

### Monitoring & Debugging

Enhanced logging provides:

- Detailed webhook payload logging
- Row update confirmations
- Fallback mechanism triggers
- Error categorization and storage

## Deployment Notes

### Immediate Benefits

- **Fixes "Waiting for playback ID" issue**: Proper playback ID extraction and storage
- **Better error visibility**: Failed videos show as "errored" instead of hanging in "processing"
- **Improved reliability**: Fallback mechanisms handle race conditions

### Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Fully backward compatible with existing video records
- ✅ Graceful handling of old webhook formats
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing API endpoints

## Verification Steps

After deployment, verify:

1. Upload a video and confirm webhook processing in logs
2. Check that `processed_at` and `playback_policy` are properly set
3. Test error scenarios (if possible) to ensure proper error handling
4. Monitor for any "No matching video record found" errors in logs
