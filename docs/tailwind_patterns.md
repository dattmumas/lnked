📊 TAILWIND USAGE PATTERNS ANALYSIS

**Files Analyzed**: 234 .tsx files
**Focus Area**: UI components and app-level components

## 🎯 COMMON UTILITY PATTERNS
1. **Text Styling**: text-muted-foreground (very common)
2. **Card Patterns**: border + rounded-lg + bg-muted/10 + p-4/p-6
3. **Interactive States**: hover:opacity-80, hover:text-foreground
4. **Layout**: flex + gap-* combinations

## 🔧 OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES
- **Card component pattern** appears 4+ times - could be standardized
- **Muted text pattern** appears 6+ times - already well abstracted
- **Interactive text** patterns could be component variants
## ⚠️ CONFLICT INDICATORS
- Editor components mix CSS classes (editor-shell) with Tailwind utilities
- No major conflicts observed - hybrid approach working
- CSS modules in preservation zone are isolated

✅ **Phase 1.2 Complete**
