## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

### **Deployment Approach: Gradual Rollout**

#### **Stage 1: Database Schema Deployment (30 minutes)**

**Objective**: Deploy database schema changes with zero downtime

**Steps**:

1. **Create database backup**

   ```sql
   -- Create comprehensive backup
   pg_dump your_database > post_001_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
   ```

2. **Deploy database schema**

   ```sql
   -- Execute production schema (from Phase 2)
   \i docs/production-database-schema.sql

   -- Verify schema deployment
   SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE table_name = 'post_collectives';

   -- Verify RLS policies
   SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname
   FROM pg_policies
   WHERE tablename = 'post_collectives';
   ```

3. **Validate schema integrity**

   ```sql
   -- Test junction table operations
   INSERT INTO post_collectives (post_id, collective_id, status)
   VALUES ('test-post-id', 'test-collective-id', 'published');

   -- Clean up test data
   DELETE FROM post_collectives WHERE post_id = 'test-post-id';
   ```

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ `post_collectives` table created successfully
- ✅ RLS policies active and functional
- ✅ Audit logging operational
- ✅ Performance indexes created
- ✅ Legacy data preserved

**Rollback Plan**: Restore from backup if schema deployment fails

---

#### **Stage 2: Application Deployment (45 minutes)**

**Objective**: Deploy application code with new multi-collective functionality

**Steps**:

1. **Build production bundle**

   ```bash
   # Clean previous build
   rm -rf .next

   # Build production application
   npm run build

   # Verify build success
   ls -la .next/static/chunks/
   ```

2. **Deploy to staging environment**

   ```bash
   # Deploy to staging first
   git push staging main

   # Run smoke tests on staging
   curl -f https://staging.yourdomain.com/posts/new
   curl -f https://staging.yourdomain.com/dashboard
   ```

3. **Deploy to production environment**

   ```bash
   # Deploy to production
   git push production main

   # Verify deployment health
   curl -f https://yourdomain.com/api/health
   ```

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ Application starts successfully
- ✅ Health checks passing
- ✅ No 500 errors in logs
- ✅ Static assets loading correctly
- ✅ Database connections healthy

**Rollback Plan**: Revert to previous application version if deployment fails

---

#### **Stage 3: Feature Validation (30 minutes)**

**Objective**: Validate core functionality and user workflows

**Validation Tests**:

1. **Individual Post Creation Workflow**

   ```
   Test: Navigate to /posts/new
   Expected: Enhanced editor loads with auto-save
   Validate: Title input and content editor functional
   ```

2. **Multi-Collective Selection**

   ```
   Test: Navigate to /posts/new/details
   Expected: Collective selection UI displays
   Validate: Modal opens, search works, selections persist
   ```

3. **Permission Validation**

   ```
   Test: Check role-based access
   Expected: Only authorized users see posting options
   Validate: Permission indicators accurate
   ```

4. **Backward Compatibility**
   ```
   Test: View existing posts and collective management
   Expected: All existing functionality preserved
   Validate: No broken links or missing features
   ```

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ All workflows functional
- ✅ Multi-collective selection working
- ✅ Permission system accurate
- ✅ Existing functionality preserved

#### **Stage 4: Gradual User Rollout (48 hours)**

**Objective**: Gradually enable new features for user segments

**Rollout Schedule**:

**Hour 0-6: Internal Team (5% of users)**

- Enable for team members and beta testers
- Monitor error rates and performance metrics
- Collect initial feedback and usage patterns

**Hour 6-12: Power Users (15% of users)**

- Validate performance under increased load

**Hour 12-24: Collective Owners (40% of users)**

- Enable for collective owners and administrators
- Monitor collective management functionality
- Ensure member guidance is effective

**Hour 24-48: All Users (100% rollout)**

- Enable for entire user base
- Full monitoring and support active
- Complete migration to new workflow

**Monitoring During Rollout**:

## 🚨 Rollback Procedures

### **Emergency Rollback (Critical Issues)**

#### **Database Rollback**

```sql
-- If database issues occur, restore from backup
-- (Only if schema corrupts data)

-- 1. Stop application connections
-- 2. Restore from backup
psql your_database < post_001_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.sql

-- 3. Verify data integrity
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM posts;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM collectives;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM collective_members;
```

#### **Application Rollback**

```bash
# Revert to previous application version
git revert HEAD --no-edit
git push production main

# Or use deployment system rollback
# kubectl rollout undo deployment/app
# heroku releases:rollback v123
```

### **Gradual Rollback (Performance Issues)**

#### **Feature Flag Rollback**

```typescript
// Implement feature flags for gradual disable
export const POST_CREATION_FEATURES = {
  MULTI_COLLECTIVE_SELECTION: process.env.ENABLE_MULTI_COLLECTIVE === 'true',
  ENHANCED_EDITOR: process.env.ENABLE_ENHANCED_EDITOR === 'true',
  COLLECTIVE_VALIDATION: process.env.ENABLE_VALIDATION === 'true',
};

// Gradual disable by percentage
export const ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE = parseInt(
  process.env.ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE || '100',
);
```

#### **Rollback Decision Matrix**

| Issue Severity         | Response Time | Action               |
| ---------------------- | ------------- | -------------------- |
| Critical (app down)    | <5 minutes    | Emergency rollback   |
| High (error rate >10%) | <15 minutes   | Gradual rollback     |
| Medium (performance)   | <30 minutes   | Feature flag disable |
| Low (UX issues)        | <2 hours      | Hot fix deployment   |
