## Summary

Successfully implemented a unified post system for the Lnked platform that consolidates separate article and video post implementations into a cohesive, maintainable architecture. The project followed a structured approach through VAN → PLAN → CREATIVE → IMPLEMENT → REFLECT → ARCHIVE phases, delivering a production-ready solution with zero regressions.

**Key Achievement**: Transformed fragmented content handling into a unified system supporting both text articles and video posts with consistent interaction patterns, optimistic UI updates, and full backward compatibility.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Unified PostCard Component**: Single component system for displaying both article and video posts in feeds
2. **Consistent Interaction Elements**: Standardized like, dislike, comment, bookmark, and share functionality across all post types
3. **Responsive Video Integration**: Seamless video player integration with thumbnails, play overlays, and duration display
4. **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with semantic HTML and keyboard navigation
5. **Lexical Content Support**: Maintain compatibility with existing rich text content system

### Technical Requirements

1. **Framework Compatibility**: Work within Next.js App Router with SSR/SSG patterns
2. **UI Library Integration**: Use existing Tailwind CSS + Radix UI component system
3. **Video Platform Integration**: Leverage Mux video player (@mux/mux-player-react)
4. **Database Integration**: Direct Supabase integration with optimistic updates
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support throughout implementation

### Design Requirements

1. **Style Guide Adherence**: Follow established Lnked Design System patterns
2. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive grid layouts
3. **Visual Consistency**: Seamless experience between different post types
4. **Performance**: Optimized rendering and interaction response times

## Implementation

### Approach

The implementation followed the "Specialized Cards with Shared Footer" architecture selected during the creative phase, utilizing a hook-based architecture with service layer integration for optimal maintainability and performance.

### Architecture Decision

**Selected Pattern**: Hook-Based Architecture with Service Layer

- Custom hooks encapsulate business logic (`usePostInteractions`)
- Direct Supabase integration for simple CRUD operations
- Optimistic UI updates with comprehensive error handling and rollback
- Component composition with shared header/footer and specialized card types

### Key Components

#### 1. Core Components (8 total)

- **`PostCardHeader.tsx`** (113 lines): Shared header component displaying author, timestamp, and collective information
- **`PostCardFooter.tsx`** (238 lines): Shared footer with interaction buttons (like, dislike, comment, bookmark, share)
- **`VideoThumbnail.tsx`** (126 lines): Video thumbnail component with play overlay and duration display
- **`ArticleCard.tsx`** (173 lines): Specialized card for text articles with thumbnail and excerpt
- **`VideoCard.tsx`** (172 lines): Specialized card for video posts with video thumbnail and metadata
- **`PostCard.tsx`** (112 lines): Unified wrapper component that routes to appropriate specialized card
- **`usePostInteractions.ts`** (274 lines): Custom hook managing state for likes, dislikes, bookmarks with optimistic updates
- **`PostFeed.tsx`** (227 lines): Feed organism component with grid layout and loading states

#### 2. State Management Architecture

```typescript
// Hook-based pattern with optimistic updates
const usePostInteractions = ({ postId, userId, initialInteractions }) => {
  // Optimistic state management
  // Error handling with rollback
  // Direct Supabase integration
  // Real-time synchronization
};
```

#### 3. Component Composition Pattern

```typescript
// Unified wrapper with type detection
<PostCard post={post} interactions={interactions} />
  ↓
{post.post_type === 'video' ?
  <VideoCard /> : <ArticleCard />}
  ↓
<PostCardHeader /> + <Content> + <PostCardFooter />
```

### Files Changed

#### New Components Created

- `src/components/app/posts/molecules/PostCardHeader.tsx` - Shared header component
- `src/components/app/posts/molecules/PostCardFooter.tsx` - Shared footer with interactions
- `src/components/app/posts/molecules/VideoThumbnail.tsx` - Video thumbnail with play overlay
