## DATA MODEL AND SCHEMA DOCUMENTATION

### Database Schema Overview

The multi-collective architecture utilizes a junction table design to support many-to-many relationships between posts and collectives while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Core Tables

#### posts table (existing, enhanced)

```sql
posts {
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    author_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    content TEXT,
    collective_id UUID REFERENCES collectives(id), -- Maintained for backward compatibility
    metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}', -- Enhanced for sharing settings
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
}
```

#### post_collectives table (new junction table)

```sql
post_collectives {
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    post_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES posts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    collective_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES collectives(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'published',
    shared_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
}
```

### Data Relationships

- **One-to-Many**: User → Posts (author relationship)
- **Many-to-Many**: Posts ↔ Collectives (via post_collectives junction table)
- **One-to-Many**: Collective → Collective Members (permission management)

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

- **post_collectives_select_policy**: Users can view associations for posts they authored or collectives they're members of
- **post_collectives_insert_policy**: Users can create associations only for posts they authored and collectives where they have posting permissions
- **post_collectives_update_policy**: Users can update associations only for posts they authored
- **post_collectives_delete_policy**: Users can delete associations only for posts they authored

### Data Migration Strategy

- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing posts retain `collective_id` during transition
- **Gradual Migration**: New posts use junction table while legacy posts remain functional
- **Zero Downtime**: Schema changes deployed without service interruption
- **Data Integrity**: Comprehensive validation and constraint enforcement

## KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER DOCUMENTATION

### System Overview for New Team Members

The POST-001 multi-collective post creation system transforms the platform from collective-centric to individual-centric content creation. Users can now create posts from their personal dashboard and share them to multiple collectives simultaneously, with real-time permission validation and an intuitive selection interface.

### Key Concepts and Terminology

- **Individual-Centric**: Posts created by individual users rather than collectives
- **Multi-Collective Sharing**: Ability to share a single post to multiple collectives
- **Junction Table**: Database design pattern for many-to-many relationships
- **Permission-Based Selection**: Collective filtering based on user's posting permissions
- **Service Layer**: Business logic layer separating concerns from UI components

### Common Tasks and Procedures

#### For Developers

- **Adding New Collective Fields**: Extend the enhanced database types and update components
- **Modifying Permission Logic**: Update PostCollectiveService validation methods
- **Adding UI Components**: Follow the established component architecture patterns
- **Database Changes**: Follow the production-first deployment workflow

#### For Operations

- **Monitoring Performance**: Check collective selection load times and query performance
- **User Support**: Guide users through the new multi-collective workflow
- **Troubleshooting**: Use audit logs for operation tracking and issue resolution
- **Deployment**: Follow the comprehensive deployment guide procedures

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How does backward compatibility work with existing posts?**
A: Existing posts retain their `collective_id` and continue functioning. New posts use the junction table for multi-collective associations.

**Q: What happens if a user loses permission to a collective after posting?**
A: The post remains associated but the user can no longer manage that association. Collective admins retain control.

**Q: How are permissions validated in real-time?**
A: React Query caches collective memberships and the UI validates permissions client-side with server-side verification.

**Q: What's the maximum number of collectives a post can be shared to?**
A: No hard limit, but the UI is optimized for typical usage of 1-10 collectives per post.
