---

## Task Overview

### **Problem Statement**

The application had significant code duplication in reaction handling:

1. **Redundant Toggle Logic**: Nearly identical optimistic update logic in `CommentsSectionItem.handleReact` vs `PostReactionButtons.handleReaction`
2. **Inconsistent API Patterns**: Comments used REST API while posts used server actions
3. **Similar UI Components**: Repeated button logic and styling patterns

### **Solution Approach**

Systematic consolidation through:

- Shared utility functions for reaction state management
- Unified server actions for consistent API patterns
- Configurable UI components for reusable interfaces

---

### ✅ **Phase 1: Shared Toggle Logic**

**File Created**: `src/lib/utils/reactionHelpers.ts` (85 lines)

**Key Features**:

- `toggleReactionState()` function for consistent optimistic updates
- `ReactionState` and `ReactionToggleResult` interfaces
- Input validation with `isValidReactionType()` type guard
- Common error handling utilities

**Impact**: Eliminated duplicate state management logic across components

### ✅ **Phase 2: Server Actions for Comments**

**File Created**: `src/app/actions/commentActions.ts` (125 lines)

**Key Features**:

- `toggleCommentReaction()` server action following post pattern
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Path revalidation support with `revalidatePath()`
- Consistent response format matching post reactions

**Impact**: Unified API patterns (server actions vs REST endpoints)

### ✅ **Phase 3: Unified Reaction Components**

**File Created**: `src/components/ui/ReactionButtons.tsx` (185 lines)

**Key Features**:

- Configurable size variants (sm/md/lg) for different contexts
- Style variants (default/comment) for appropriate visual hierarchy
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure
- Consistent accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Generic reaction handler interface for flexibility

**Impact**: Reusable component for both comments and posts with consistent behavior

### ✅ **Phase 4-6: Component Refactoring**

**CommentsSectionItem.tsx**: Updated (229 → 150 lines, -79 lines)

- Replaced manual reaction logic with ReactionButtons component
- Now uses server actions instead of REST API calls
- Added postSlug prop support for path revalidation

**PostReactionButtons.tsx**: Refactored (116 → 45 lines, -71 lines)

- Internally uses ReactionButtons while maintaining backward compatibility
- Preserved existing component API for seamless integration

**CommentsSection.tsx**: Enhanced (193 lines)

- Added postSlug prop for proper revalidation chain
- Passes postSlug to child components
