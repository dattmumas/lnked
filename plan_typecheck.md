| 1   | **`/src/app/(public)/profile/[username]/followers/page.tsx`** and **`/src/app/(public)/users/[userId]/followers/page.tsx`** | **Duplicate follower pages:** There are two nearly identical pages for listing a user’s followers – one accessed by username and one by user ID. This redundancy means maintenance overhead and potential inconsistency.                                                                                                                                                   | **Unify or remove one:** Eliminate the redundant page. Use a single followers page (preferably by username) and redirect or link ID-based requests to that page, so all user follower logic lives in one place.                                                                                                              |
| 2   | **`UserFollowersPage` & `CollectiveFollowersPage`** (`followers/page.tsx` in user vs collective routes)                     | **Repeated UI code for follower lists:** Both the user followers page and the collective followers page implement the same UI for listing followers (avatars, names, “No followers yet” message, etc.). The rendering logic is duplicated across files.                                                                                                                    | **Abstract shared component:** Create a reusable follower list component (e.g., `<FollowerList>`) that accepts data and renders the follower entries. Use this component in both pages to avoid repeating the markup and ensure consistency.                                                                                 |
| 3   | **`src/app/actions/followActions.ts`**                                                                                      | **Redundant follow/unfollow logic:** The follow/unfollow routines for users and collectives are implemented as separate functions with similar structure. Both check auth, handle already-following cases, and perform inserts/deletes in the `follows` table, but with slight inconsistencies (e.g., handling of “already following” differs between user vs collective). | **Refactor common code:** Consolidate shared follow logic (auth checks, DB operations) into a helper used by both user and collective functions. Ensure consistent behavior (e.g., treat “already following” uniformly). This reduces repetition and makes future changes (like error handling) easier to apply across both. |
| 4   | **`src/components/PostLikeButton.tsx`**                                                                                     | **Unused component (dead code):** This component for liking posts exists in the codebase but is never imported or rendered in the app (the post UI uses `PostReactionButtons` instead). It appears to be a leftover from an earlier implementation of post likes.                                                                                                          | **Remove or integrate:** If `PostReactionButtons` has fully replaced it, remove `PostLikeButton.tsx` to avoid confusion. (If not fully replaced, consider integrating it properly; however, given `PostReactionButtons` covers likes/dislikes, the standalone like button is likely obsolete.)                               |
| 5   | **`src/components/app/newsletters/molecules/SubscribeButton.tsx`**                                                          | **Unreferenced “Subscribe” button:** The SubscribeButton component (for subscribing to a user’s or collective’s newsletter) is present but not used anywhere in the UI. It’s likely part of a not-yet-implemented feature (even a TODO notes adding an initial subscription state).                                                                                        | **Implement or remove:** If a newsletter subscription feature is planned, integrate this component into the appropriate page (e.g., user profile or collective page) and implement its functionality. Otherwise, remove it until the feature is ready to avoid carrying unused code.                                         |
| 6   | **`src/components/app/nav/RouteProgress.tsx`**                                                                              | **Unneeded component:** This client-side route progress indicator is defined but never actually used (no `<RouteProgress>` in the app). It seems to be an idea for showing a loading bar on page transitions, left unused.                                                                                                                                                 | **Remove or utilize:** If a loading indicator on route change is desired, properly integrate this component (e.g., include it in the layout with route change events). If not, removing it will clean up the codebase.                                                                                                       |
| 7   | **Duplicate ModeToggle components:** _(`src/components/ui/mode-toggle.tsx` and `src/components/app/nav/ModeToggle.tsx`)_    | **Duplicate implementation:** There are two ModeToggle components for theme switching. The app uses the one under `app/nav/ModeToggle.tsx`, while another exists in the UI library folder and is not referenced. Keeping both can cause confusion.                                                                                                                         | **Keep one, delete the other:** Remove the unused `ui/mode-toggle.tsx` file. Use the `ModeToggle` in `app/nav` exclusively (or vice versa), so there is a single authoritative theme toggle component.                                                                                                                       |
| 8   | **Old comments API routes:** _(`src/app/api/comments/[commentId]/_`)\*                                                      | **Obsolete API endpoints:** The project has a newer comment system (under `comments-v2` in the API) and legacy comment endpoints. The presence of `/api/comments-v2/...` alongside `/api/comments/...` suggests the old routes are likely no longer used by the front end.                                                                                                 | **Deprecate legacy endpoints:** If the front-end now uses `comments-v2`, remove or disable the old `/api/comments` routes and related code. This avoids maintaining dead code and prevents confusion over which comment API is in use.                                                                                       |
| 9   | **`src/app/(public)/profile/[username]/followers/page.tsx`**                                                                | **Inefficient data fetching:** The user followers page fetches follower profiles in two steps (first getting follower IDs with a join, then separately querying the `users` table for profile details). This double round-trip is redundant – the initial query already joins user profile fields.                                                                         | **Optimize query logic:** Simplify to a single query. For example, use the Supabase join (as already done) to retrieve `followers` with their profile data and use that directly. Remove the extra `profilesData` fetch and combination loop. This will reduce duplicate work and improve performance.                       |
