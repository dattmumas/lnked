# MUX Integration Compliance Updates Summary

This document summarizes all the changes made to ensure proper compliance with MUX best practices and schema consistency.

## 1. Upload Workflow Simplification ✅

### Changes Made:

- **Replaced custom XHR upload** with official `@mux/mux-uploader-react` SDK in `VideoUploader.tsx`
- **Deleted unused upload service** (`upload-service.ts`)
- **Updated CORS configuration** in `/api/videos/upload-url` to use proper origin instead of wildcard `*`
- **Enabled MP4 support** with `mp4_support: 'capped-1080p'` for video downloads
- **Removed MUX proxy** from `next.config.ts` as it's no longer needed

## 2. Video Playback Consolidation ✅

### Changes Made:

- **Removed hls.js dependency** as MUX Player SDK handles HLS internally
- **Simplified download logic** to use known MP4 URLs based on `mp4_support` setting
- **Added MUX Data support** in `MuxVideoPlayerSimple.tsx` with optional environment key
- **Removed custom analytics code** in favor of MUX Data's built-in analytics

## 3. Schema and Data Consistency ✅

### Changes Made:

#### API Routes Updated:

1. **`/api/videos/upload-url`** - Now correctly stores upload ID in `mux_upload_id` column
2. **`/api/videos/[id]/route.ts` (DELETE)** - Updated to check both `mux_upload_id` and `mux_asset_id` fields
3. **`/api/videos/[id]/refresh`** - Properly handles upload vs asset IDs using separate columns
4. **`/api/mux-webhook`** - Fixed to update correct columns based on webhook event type

#### Key Pattern Changes:

- **Before**: Upload IDs were stored in `mux_asset_id` column, requiring `startsWith('upload-')` checks
- **After**: Upload IDs in `mux_upload_id`, asset IDs in `mux_asset_id` - proper separation

#### Database Schema Updates (see `schema_updates.sql`):

- Added `mux_upload_id` and `mp4_support` columns if missing
- Created index on `mux_upload_id` for faster webhook lookups
- Added constraint to prevent upload IDs in `mux_asset_id` column
- Updated `find_video_by_mux_id` function to search both columns
- Added proper RLS policies for security

## 4. Environment Variables Needed

Add these to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# MUX API Credentials (required)
MUX_TOKEN_ID=your_token_id
MUX_TOKEN_SECRET=your_token_secret
MUX_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret

# MUX Data Analytics (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_MUX_DATA_ENV_KEY=your_mux_data_env_key

# App URL for CORS
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

## 5. Benefits of These Changes

1. **Cleaner Code**: Removed ~300 lines of custom upload logic
2. **Better Reliability**: MUX SDK handles retries, chunking, and edge cases
3. **Improved Security**: Proper CORS configuration instead of wildcard
4. **Data Integrity**: Clear separation between upload and asset IDs
5. **Future-Proof**: Following MUX's documented patterns makes upgrades easier

## 6. Migration Steps

1. Apply the SQL migrations in `schema_updates.sql`
2. Deploy the updated API routes
3. Test upload flow with new MuxUploader component
4. Verify webhooks are updating the correct columns
5. Check that existing videos still play correctly

## 7. Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload a new video and verify it creates with `mux_upload_id`
- [ ] Check webhook updates `mux_asset_id` when upload completes
- [ ] Verify refresh endpoint correctly checks upload status
- [ ] Test video deletion for both uploads and assets
- [ ] Confirm MP4 downloads work with new URL pattern
- [ ] Validate MUX Player shows analytics (if env key set)
