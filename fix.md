2. Handling Overlapping Visibility
   When a user has access to a post via multiple paths (for example, they are a member of two collectives that a post was shared with, or they both follow the author and are in a collective), the post should still appear only once for that user. We need to de-duplicate results across the overlapping access conditions. Approach: Use a query that inherently unions the accessible posts and eliminates duplicates, or combine results in code and de-dup:
   Single-Query (Database Union): Construct a database query or view that selects posts visible to a given user with a UNION of conditions, and use DISTINCT on post ID. For example (in pseudo-SQL):
   sql
   Copy
   Edit
   SELECT DISTINCT p.id, p.title, p.content, ...
   FROM posts p
   LEFT JOIN post_collectives pc ON p.id = pc.post_id
   LEFT JOIN collective_members cm ON pc.collective_id = cm.collective_id AND cm.user_id = :currentUser
   LEFT JOIN user_follows f ON p.author_id = f.followee_id AND f.follower_id = :currentUser
   WHERE
   p.is_public = TRUE
   OR cm.user_id IS NOT NULL -- user is a member of at least one collective the post is in
   OR f.follower_id IS NOT NULL -- user follows the author (for personal posts)
   OR p.author_id = :currentUser -- (include author’s own posts for completeness)
   ;
   This query will return any post that the user can access via any of the criteria. The DISTINCT (or the nature of the JOINs) prevents duplicate rows if a post satisfies multiple conditions.
   Multiple Query Combination: Alternatively, fetch posts per category (one query for collective membership, one for followed authors, etc.) and then combine in application code. This is less efficient but can reuse caches for each subset. The current frontend is doing something similar: e.g. one request for current tenant posts, one for collective posts, one for followed posts, then merging with a Set to de-duplicate. For scalability, a single well-optimized query or a database view is preferable, but in either case, deduplication by post ID is required to handle overlaps.
3. Efficient Querying and Authorization
   Database Indices: Optimize the relevant lookups with indexes:
   Add an index on the join table by collective_id (and post_id as a secondary column) to quickly retrieve all posts for a given collective. Similarly, an index on post_collectives(post_id) helps when joining from posts to collectives.
   Ensure there’s an index on the collective membership table by user_id (to find all collectives a user belongs to) and on user_follows by follower_id (to find all authors a user follows). These indexes support fast existence checks in the query.
   If posts.is_public or visibility is used, index that column if queries often filter on it (though it might be fine as a low-selectivity flag).
   Query Strategy: Use set-based queries rather than scanning every post:
   Utilize the join approach outlined above so that the database engine filters posts by matching the user’s memberships/follows. This way, the amount of data scanned is proportional to the user’s circle (number of followed authors + collectives) rather than all posts. For example, joining through collective_members directly narrows candidates to posts in those collectives.
   Alternatively, maintain a materialized view or a specialized RPC (remote procedure) on the database that returns the feed for a user. Supabase could use Postgres row-level security (RLS) policies to automatically restrict select on the posts table to only those rows the user should see, but implementing our own explicit checks as above gives more control. If RLS is used, ensure the policy conditions mirror the logic (member of collective OR follower of author OR public).
   Authorization Checks: On the backend (e.g. in API routes or server components), enforce that when a specific post is requested, the user has access:
   Write a helper that, given a post_id and a user_id, quickly checks membership or follow status. This can be done with one query joining the post_collectives and membership tables as illustrated, or by caching a user’s accessible tenant IDs.
   Cache membership lists: Since authorization checks for many posts will repeatedly examine the same user’s memberships, it’s efficient to cache the list of collective IDs a user belongs to and the list of user IDs they follow. This could be done in memory or a fast cache store (e.g. keep a set in Redis or use Supabase’s built-in caching). The Home page already caches the user’s tenant list (as seen with getCachedUserTenants) – this can be leveraged so we don’t query membership every time. Using that, the server can derive a set of accessible tenant IDs (all the user’s collective IDs plus the user’s own personal tenant and any other personal tenant they follow).
   When querying posts, convert the problem to checking if post_collectives.collective_id intersects with the user’s allowed tenant IDs. A query with ... WHERE pc.collective_id = ANY(:allowedTenantIds) is efficient if the list is not too large and is indexed.
   By thoughtfully indexing and using set-membership checks in SQL, we avoid full table scans and ensure queries remain quick even as data grows.
4. Backend Model, Indexing, and Caching for Scalability
   Backend Model Recap:
   posts: Contains core post info and a visibility indicator (could be boolean is_public and/or a more detailed field).
   post_collectives: Maps posts to collectives (many-to-many). Important fields: post_id, collective_id. The presence of a row means the post is shared with that collective. (We’ve seen foreign keys enforcing this relationship.)
   collective_members (or user_tenants): Links user to collective (with roles).
   user_follows: Links a follower to an author (for personal content access).
   Ensure these tables have proper foreign keys (as indicated in the schema snippet) and cascading deletes so no orphan entries remain. Indexing: In addition to the indices mentioned:
   Composite index on collective_members(collective_id, user_id) (or the reverse) can speed up checking if a given user is in a specific collective and listing user’s collectives.
   If queries often filter by post attributes (date, status like published/draft), have indexes on those as well, but those are more for feed sorting rather than auth.
   Caching Strategies: Caching will be essential as the number of posts and users grows:
   Per-Tenant Caching: Cache recent posts for each collective and each personal feed. For example, a caching layer could store the latest N posts for collective X. Then assembling a user’s feed can fetch from those caches for each collective they belong to. This reduces direct DB hits. Invalidation would occur when a new post is added to a collective or an existing one is removed/updated – e.g., tag the cache by collective and clear it when a new post is shared to that collective.
   Per-User Feed Cache: Because each user’s feed is a union of multiple sources, caching the fully resolved personal feed per user is harder (it’s very dynamic). However, after computing it once, a short-lived cache (even for a few seconds or a minute) could be used to serve rapid repeat requests. Given personalization, it may be more efficient to cache components (per-collective as above) than whole user feeds.
   Membership Cache: Cache the list of allowedTenantIds for each user (their collective memberships plus personal ID and followed users’ personal IDs). This list changes only when the user follows/unfollows someone or joins/leaves a collective. It can be stored in memory or a fast-access store. The application already hints at caching user tenant info and providing invalidation hooks (e.g. invalidateUserTenantCache when memberships change). We can extend that: on a follow/unfollow event, invalidate or update the follow cache for that user.
   Use Content Delivery for Public Posts: If certain posts are fully public, they might be served on public pages or feeds that can be globally cached (CDN, etc.). Public content can be indexed and retrieved without per-user computation, improving scalability for that subset of posts.
   Scalable Enforcement: The combination of the above ensures that authorization checks don’t become a bottleneck:
   The database acts as the first gate by only returning posts meeting the user’s criteria (with the help of joins or RLS).
   The caches and indexes minimize the cost of repetitive checks (like computing memberships or retrieving the same posts multiple times).
   Whenever a user’s access changes (new membership or post sharing updated), we invalidate relevant caches. For example, if a post’s share list is edited (post is now shared with an additional collective), we’d update that collective’s cache and the affected users’ feeds if needed. Tools like Next.js’s revalidation tags or Supabase’s real-time notifications can trigger these invalidations.
   By designing the model with join tables and using indexed queries, we support complex visibility (multiple collectives per post) without duplicating post content. Overlapping access is handled by unioning results and de-duplication. This model aligns with the “individual-centric, share with multiple collectives” approach and will scale with proper query optimization and caching in place. Each new post or membership change will only require localized updates (to caches or indices), keeping feed generation fast and correct for all users.
