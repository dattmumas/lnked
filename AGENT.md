Profile Page Layout Specification
Overview and Design Goals
The profile page layout is designed for content creators, journalists, and academics who produce rich multimedia content. It is a desktop-first design optimized for heavy content consumption, while remaining responsive for smaller screens. The goal is to mimic the richness and readability of a news site (long-form articles, media, clear hierarchy) and integrate the dynamic, social feel of a Twitter/X feed. Key design features include:
Balanced Multimedia Presentation: A unified main feed intermixes videos, text articles, and audio posts in chronological order, ensuring no content type overwhelms the others. This unified feed “weaves these voices together” for the reader
github.com
instead of fragmenting content by medium.
Audio Content Showcase: A horizontal audio post slider at the top of the main feed highlights podcasts or audio updates in a carousel format, giving audio equal prominence without disrupting the feed flow.
Integrated Feed with Filters: The primary feed shows all content types chronologically, with optional filter tabs (e.g. All, Articles, Videos, Audio) to let users drill down by format. This gives flexibility to consume specific media types on demand.
Right-Side Microthread Panel: A scrollable side panel on the right houses a Twitter/X-style microthread feed – short-form posts and updates from the profile – providing social media-like snippets alongside the main content.
Pinned Content: The layout supports pinned content at the top of the profile’s feed – for example, a flagship article or introduction – that remains featured above the rest.
Minimal Metadata Emphasis: Content cards display only high-level engagement and context metadata: likes/dislikes, comment count, timestamp, and author name. This keeps the interface uncluttered and focused on content.
Profile Search: A prominent search function allows users to search across the entire content catalog of the profile (all posts, regardless of type). Searches route to a dedicated results page for in-depth filtering.
Embedded External Media: External content (YouTube videos, Spotify embeds, tweets, etc.) can be embedded within native content cards, maintaining a consistent look and feel for a seamless reading experience.
Light Theming Customization: Profile owners can lightly customize the page’s look – choosing a theme variant or accent color, basic typography preference, and an optional banner/cover image – to reflect their identity. All customization stays within a consistent design system for uniformity.
Collective Profile Support: Profiles can represent collectives (multi-contributor publications). These pages maintain a singular branding controlled by the owner, while allowing multiple contributors’ content to appear (each post still credits its author). The result is a unified profile identity with diverse contributors.
This specification details the structural hierarchy, component relationships, user flows, and visual priorities for the profile page. It is structured as an implementation-ready overview, with wireframe-level descriptions for each section of the layout.
Layout Structure and Hierarchy
The profile page is organized as a two-column layout with a clear content hierarchy. Below is the high-level structure:
Profile Header (Top Section): Spanning the full width at the top, it contains the profile’s identity and global actions (profile picture, name, bio, follow/subscribe button, and search bar).
Main Content Area (Left Column): The primary column containing the content feed and media:
Audio Content Slider – a horizontal scrolling carousel of recent audio posts (if any).
Content Filter Tabs – a tab bar to switch between All content vs. specific types (videos, text, audio).
Pinned Content – one or more pinned posts featured at the top of the feed.
Integrated Feed List – chronological feed of content cards (mixed media types).
Right Sidebar (Right Column): A secondary column containing the microthread feed (short posts timeline). This panel is vertically scrollable and runs parallel to the main feed content.
On desktop and large screens, the main content column occupies the majority of width (for readability, e.g. ~70%) while the side panel is narrower (e.g. ~30% width). This ensures the main feed is visually dominant. Both columns can scroll independently if content overflows the viewport height. For example, a user can scroll the microthread panel without losing their place in the main feed. The side panel may use a sticky positioning so that it remains visible as the user scrolls the longer main column.
Responsive Behavior: On smaller screens (tablet or mobile), this two-column layout collapses into one column for simplicity. The microthread feed might become a collapsible section or a secondary tab below the main feed. The design remains functional on mobile, but the desktop layout is the primary reference for the specification.
Profile Header and Identity Section
At the very top of the profile page, the header provides the essential information about the creator or collective and entry points to key actions:
Profile Identity: On the left side of the header, display the profile’s avatar or logo (for individuals, a profile photo; for collectives, a logo or representative image) alongside the profile name. The name is prominently shown (e.g. using a larger heading font) with possibly a subtitle or short bio/tagline underneath in a smaller font. This gives context about who or what the profile represents (e.g. an author’s title or a collective’s mission statement). All text here uses the site’s typography styles for headings and body (ensuring consistency with the design system’s fonts and sizes).
Follow/Subscribe Button: Adjacent to the name (or on the right side of the header) is a call-to-action button for users to follow or subscribe to this profile. This button uses the standard button component style (e.g. a primary-colored button) for visibility. For collectives, if applicable, there might also be an indicator of the number of members or a subscribe-to-newsletter link here.
Search Bar: A search input field or search icon is included in the header area, allowing users to search within this profile’s content. On desktop, a full search input with a placeholder (e.g. "Search all posts...") could be shown in the top-right of the header for quick access. If space is constrained, a magnifying-glass icon can toggle a search input. Activating search will redirect the user to a separate search results page for that profile’s content (details on search behavior are in a later section).
Theming Elements: The header section also reflects any custom theming set by the profile owner. For instance, if the user has set a custom accent color or background, it will appear here – perhaps as an accent underline on the profile name or as the background color of the header bar. Profiles may also feature a cover image/banner behind the header (spanning full width) if provided. The image would be cropped to a moderate height and could be overlaid by the profile name and avatar. All theme customizations (e.g. primaryColor or cover image) are applied via CSS variables or inline style on this section to match the owner’s preferences
github.com
. The design system ensures sufficient contrast and legibility over any custom banner (using overlays or requiring certain brightness of the image if needed).
Overall, the header’s design is clean and minimalist, providing an immediate sense of identity and allowing the user to engage (follow or search) right away. It uses consistent spacing (e.g. padding based on the 8px grid) around elements so that it stands out without feeling cluttered.
Audio Content Slider (Featured Audio Posts)
Immediately below the header (and spanning the main content column width) is the audio content slider. This is a horizontally scrolling carousel showcasing the profile’s audio content (if the profile publishes audio, such as podcasts or narrated articles):
Slider Content: Each audio post is represented by a card or tile in the carousel. The tile might include the audio cover art or thumbnail, the title of the audio piece, and possibly a short subtitle or duration. It could also incorporate a small play button icon overlaying the thumbnail to indicate it’s playable content. The cards are styled in line with the native content cards (consistent background, slight shadow or border) so they feel like part of the site, not an embedded widget.
Layout & Interaction: The audio cards are arranged in a row, within a container that shows a few cards at a time (e.g. 3-4 tiles visible, depending on screen width). Users can scroll this row horizontally to see more audio posts. On desktop, arrow buttons on either end of the slider allow navigation, or users can use click-and-drag (or a trackpad swipe) to scroll. This component is akin to a “carousel” of audio content, ensuring audio posts get visibility without taking excessive vertical space.
Placement: This slider is positioned at the top of the main content area so that it’s one of the first elements the user sees after the profile header. The rationale is that audio content can often be overlooked in a vertical feed; by giving it a dedicated horizontal section, audio gets immediate attention and equal billing with written or video content.
Behavior: Clicking an audio tile could either play a preview inline or navigate to the post’s detail page (where a full audio player and transcript might reside). If inline playback is supported, the tile might expand to show an audio player controls. For simplicity in layout spec, assume clicking opens the content page, and inline play is an enhancement. The slider itself is static in height (ensuring it doesn’t resize the page as content changes). It may be set to auto-scroll or highlight the newest audio item initially.
Visually, the audio slider uses the profile’s accent theme subtly (for example, the active audio or hover state might use the accent color). It has padding above and below to separate it from the header and the content list below. If the profile has no audio content, this section is omitted entirely (the design should collapse gracefully, with the feed moving up).
Content Filter Tabs
Beneath the audio slider (or beneath the header if no audio slider is shown), the interface provides a set of filter tabs that let users switch the view of the main feed by content type:
Tabs Available: The typical tabs include All, Articles (or Text), Videos, and Audio. “All” is the default, showing every post type mixed together. The other tabs filter the feed to show only posts of that specific type (e.g. selecting Videos will refresh the feed list to only show video posts).
Design & Style: The tabs are presented as a horizontal menu (like a sub-navigation bar). Each tab is a text label (short, single word) using a medium weight font, possibly in uppercase or a distinguishable style for clarity. The active tab is highlighted with the primary accent color or an underline indicator. For example, the active state might be indicated by a colored bottom border beneath the tab text or a pill-style highlight behind the text.
Interaction: Clicking a tab dynamically updates the feed content below. Only one tab can be active at a time. The tabs are UI elements styled as accessible buttons or links (ensuring proper ARIA roles for tablist behavior). The transition between tabs can be instantaneous (client-side filtering) with a subtle animation or fade, so the user perceives the content change smoothly.
Optional Display: If a profile does not have certain content types, those tabs can be disabled or hidden. For instance, if an academic has only written articles and no videos, the Videos tab might not appear, or it could appear but with a disabled state. This prevents empty feed views.
Mobile/Responsive Handling: On smaller screens, these tabs might convert to a dropdown menu or a horizontally scrollable mini-strip to avoid squeezing too many buttons.
The filter tabs give power-users a quick way to parse content by type, but by default most visitors will stay on All to enjoy the mixed-media experience. The design ensures that the tab bar itself is not too tall or obtrusive (likely just the height of a normal nav bar) so it doesn’t take away from content space. It’s affixed below the audio slider, and possibly uses a sticky position when the page scrolls (so that if a user scrolls far down, the tab bar could stick to the top of the viewport allowing quick re-filtering without scrolling back up – this is a design enhancement that improves navigation efficiency).
Main Content Feed (Chronological Posts)
The main content feed is the heart of the profile page, occupying the left (main) column. It presents a chronological list of content posts (articles, videos, audio entries, etc.) in descending order (newest first by publish date). This feed is designed for readability and scannability, much like a news site’s article list, but with rich media integration. Feed Layout:
The feed is a single-column list of content cards. Each post is contained in a card component that provides a snapshot of the content. The cards stack vertically with consistent spacing (e.g. a 16px or 24px gap between them, following the 8px grid scale).
The width of the feed column is optimized for text readability (not too wide). For example, the content column might be constrained to a maximum width (like max-width: 700px or similar) to prevent very long line lengths for text excerpts. This mimics the feel of a news site or blog where content is centered and easy on the eyes.
Each card in the feed includes a few key elements:
Thumbnail/Media Preview: If the post contains media (image or video), a thumbnail is shown at the top of the card. For video content, the thumbnail could be a frame from the video with a “play” icon overlay indicating it’s a video. For text articles, a featured image or thumbnail may be shown (if the article has one) or else a simple placeholder graphic (or no thumbnail, focusing on text). For audio posts, if not featured in the top slider, a smaller audio waveform or cover image can be used as a thumbnail. All media previews are scaled to fit within the card width, using a consistent aspect ratio (e.g. 16:9 for videos) to maintain a uniform look.
Title/Headline: The title of the post is displayed prominently (likely as a clickable link or heading). This uses larger font (e.g. the text-lg or xl style from the design system) for emphasis. The title should be concise and give an idea of the content.
Excerpt or Description: For text-based content, a short excerpt or summary (a couple of lines) is shown below the title to entice reading. For videos or audio, a brief description or caption might be shown if available (otherwise possibly the duration or format could be listed). This excerpt text is in a smaller, muted font to clearly differentiate it from the title.
Metadata Line: At either the top or bottom of the card (commonly below the excerpt), a line of metadata provides context: author name, published timestamp, like/dislike counts, and comment count. This line is in a smaller font (e.g. text-sm) and a muted color, to be visible but not distracting. It may read like: “AuthorName – 5 hours ago – ▲ 120 ▼ 3 – 💬 45”, where the triangles represent upvote/like and downvote/dislike counts, and the speech bubble represents comments. This corresponds to the data fields tracked in the system (each post has an author, and numeric counts for likes, dislikes, comments, etc. are stored)
github.com
.
Visual Styling: Each content card uses the platform’s Card component styling
github.com
, giving a clean container with perhaps a light background (on light theme), subtle border or shadow, and consistent padding. The design is minimalist (no excessive borders or decorations, aligning with the design system’s aesthetic) so that the content preview stands out. On hover (desktop), the card might slightly elevate or highlight to indicate interactivity.
Embedded External Content: If a post’s content is an external embed (for example, a YouTube video post or an embedded Tweet within an article), the feed card still presents it in a native style. For instance, a YouTube video post might show the video thumbnail and title as if it were a native video content card, possibly with the YouTube logo or a subtle indicator. The actual player will be available on the post detail page, but it could also be playable inline if desired (not required in the feed view). The key is that even external media is framed in the same card style, maintaining visual consistency across the feed.
Pinned Content Behavior: If the profile owner has marked a post as “pinned,” that post’s card will appear at the very top of the feed, regardless of its date. Pinned content is thus an exception to the strict chronological order (all other non-pinned posts follow newest-first order below it). If multiple items can be pinned (depending on feature scope), they could either all appear at top (in a pinned section) or rotate, but likely only one pinned item for simplicity. A pinned post is usually visually distinguished — for example, it might have a small “Pinned” label or icon (a pin icon) on the card, or a different background shade to draw attention. However, it should still align with the overall card design. Users immediately see this highlighted content when they visit the profile, ensuring important content gets noticed. Scrolling and Pagination: The feed will potentially list many pieces of content. It can use infinite scrolling (loading more as the user scrolls) or chunked pagination (load more button or page numbers) depending on the implementation. The layout is compatible with either approach. The initial view will load a generous number of recent posts to give the page a rich feel, similar to a news site showing many headlines. By integrating all media types together, the feed allows readers to consume the profile’s content in one place without jumping between sections. This unified approach resonates with the platform’s mission to avoid fragmented content across various channels
github.com
. A reader can seamlessly scroll from a text article preview, to a video post, to another article, etc., following the chronology of publication.
Content Card Component Details
Each content item in the feed uses a Content Card component – an element that encapsulates the preview and metadata for that post. Detailing the component structure and relationships:
Container: The card’s outer container (e.g. a <div> or <article> tag) is a clickable unit (hover effects apply here). Clicking anywhere on the card (except perhaps on specific interactive sub-elements like a play button) will navigate to the full content view (e.g., article page or video page).
Media Thumbnail Subcomponent: If present, this sits at the top of the card. It could be an <img> tag for images/thumbnails or a video player element if inline playback is allowed. It is often wrapped in a container that preserves aspect ratio. For video, an overlay play icon is centered over the thumbnail to signify it’s video content. For audio, an image or stylized audio waveform could be shown.
Textual Content Subcomponent: Below the thumbnail (or at top if no media preview), a text block contains:
Title (<h2> or <h3>): linked to the content. It might truncate after two lines if very long, to keep card height reasonable.
Excerpt/description (<p>): a brief snippet of the content or description, truncated to a few lines. In case of a video post without a lot of text description, this might be omitted or replaced by some metadata like “Video – 10 min watch”.
Metadata line: This can be a <div> or <footer> of the card. It includes:
Author name: Clicking the author might link to their profile (for collective posts where author isn’t the profile owner, to view that contributor’s own page). On an individual’s profile, the author is the profile owner themselves, so it could just be text (or omitted since it’s redundant – but likely kept for consistency of layout). If the profile is a collective, showing the author is crucial (e.g. “by Alice Smith” on a post in a collective profile).
Timestamp: A relative time (e.g. “3 days ago” or an absolute date) when the post was published. This gives context on recency.
Likes/Dislikes: Represented by icons (e.g. ▲ and ▼, or a heart/thumbs-up and a broken-heart/thumbs-down icon) followed by the count of each. Having both like and dislike counts visible encourages transparent feedback. For example, a post might show “▲ 120 ▼ 3” meaning 120 likes and 3 dislikes. These numbers correspond to fields in the database (like_count and dislike_count) for each post
github.com
. The UI only surfaces them; interacting with them (to like/dislike) would typically be done on the content’s page or via a quick action if provided.
Comments: An icon (speech bubble) with the number of comments. This indicates discussion activity. (Clicking this might jump to the post page’s comment section; in the profile feed it’s just informational.)
Responsive adjustments: On narrower screens, the content card might stack elements differently. For example, the thumbnail might become full-width above text (which it already is on desktop basically), and the metadata might wrap to a second line if needed. All text should remain legible (using responsive typography scaling if necessary).
All these subcomponents work together to give a concise overview of the content. The component relationships are such that the card can be generated from a single data object (post) that includes: media (if any), title, excerpt, author info, timestamps, and counts. The styling uses utility classes and design tokens for color and spacing, e.g., using neutral background and text-muted for metadata. This uniform card design ensures a cohesive look whether the content is an internally created article or an embedded external piece. It abstracts away the differences so that a YouTube video or a PDF document link, for instance, will still appear as a “post card” in the feed rather than a raw external widget.
Right Sidebar: Microthread Feed
On the right side of the page, a dedicated microthread feed panel provides a stream of short-form updates in a style reminiscent of Twitter/X. This side feed serves as a more social, immediate counterpart to the main content feed. Its presence encourages quick updates and interactions without overshadowing the main content. Content and Format:
Each entry in the microthread feed is a micro-post – typically a short text update (e.g. a sentence or two, similar to a tweet), possibly with a single image or link. These might be status updates, brief insights, or links shared by the profile owner (or collective).
Micro-posts are displayed in reverse chronological order (newest at top) within the side panel. Unlike the main feed, these entries usually don’t have titles; they are more like status messages. They may or may not allow replies/comments inline (depending on feature set), but for this layout spec, assume they are simply listed with their content and a timestamp.
If a micro-post is part of a thread (i.e., a reply or continuation of a previous micro-post), it can be visually indented or grouped (for example, show the original post followed by a slightly indented reply beneath it). However, given space constraints in a narrow column, it may be simpler to treat each entry as separate and link out to a full thread view if needed. For now, we consider them as individual posts for clarity.
Design & Styling:
The microthread panel has a minimalist look, possibly with no distinct card borders for each post (to emulate the seamless flow of a social feed). Each micro-post might just be separated by subtle dividers or spacing. The text is typically smaller than article text (maybe the base text size or slightly smaller) since these are quick reads.
Each micro-post shows the content text, truncated if it’s too long (with an option to expand if necessary or a link to a detail page for that micro-post). If the profile owner includes a link or media, a tiny preview (like a thumbnail or link preview) could be embedded, but kept small to fit the column.
A timestamp (relative time) is shown for each micro-post (e.g., “2h ago”), usually at the bottom or top in a muted font. The author name might not be needed for an individual profile’s own micro-posts (since it’s the same person each time), but on a collective’s micro feed, it could show the poster’s handle if multiple people contribute to micro-updates. However, for consistency and simplicity, the micro-feed can be thought of as primarily the voice of the profile itself. So in a collective, micro-updates would likely be posted under the collective’s name (e.g. staff announcements) rather than by individual members, to maintain the singular identity.
Interaction options on micro-posts (like like/retweet/reply icons) can be present on hover or as small icons, but since we focus on layout, we’ll note them as possible but not required in this spec. The main point is these entries are lightweight and interactive in spirit.
Behavior and Scrolling:
The side panel itself is scrollable independent of the main feed. It might have its own thin scrollbar. If the main page is scrolled, the side panel can remain in a fixed position (e.g. using CSS position: sticky; top: 100px after some offset) so that once the header is scrolled past, the micro-feed stays visible on the side as the user scrolls the main content. This way, the user can always glance at short updates while reading through longer posts.
The microthread feed likely autoupdates or can be refreshed regularly (not a layout concern, but it implies the design can accommodate new items appearing at the top, possibly with a highlight or a “new posts” indicator).
The microthread panel provides a secondary content stream that complements the main feed. Visual prioritization ensures it does not steal focus: it’s narrower, uses slightly smaller text/images, and is off to the side. The user’s eye naturally goes to the larger main column first. However, the micro-feed’s presence adds a dynamic element to the page – akin to reading a news article while seeing a live ticker or commentary on the right. It captures the “social thread dynamics” by showing bite-sized thoughts and interactions continuously.
Search Functionality
The profile page includes an integrated search function to help users quickly find content within that profile’s catalog. The design and flow for search are as follows:
Search Input Placement: The search input is located in the top header (as described earlier). On desktop, it could be an input box labeled with a search icon and placeholder text. On mobile or smaller screens, it might be hidden under a search icon button (which expands to a full-width search bar when tapped).
Scope of Search: By default, this search is scoped to the profile’s content only. It will query across all content types – articles, videos, audio transcripts/descriptions, and possibly even microthread posts – to return relevant results. This unified search fits with the platform’s unified content approach (the database is likely using a text search vector for all posts
github.com
).
Execution: When the user enters a query and submits, the page navigates to a Search Results Page specific to that profile (likely a route like /[profile]/search?query=...). This results page is separate from the profile layout, allowing the user to see a full list of results without the profile’s feed in view.
Search Results Page Layout: (Briefly, since it’s part of the flow) – The results page would list matching posts in a format similar to the feed (perhaps smaller cards or a simplified list for compactness). It may also allow filtering by type in the results context. A “Back to profile” link or the profile’s navigation would allow returning to the main profile page.
Design Considerations: The search bar in the header is designed to be clearly visible but not overly dominant. It might use a subtle background fill (e.g. a slight gray or the card color) and a rounded border to appear as a search field. When focused, it could expand or highlight. The search icon within the field is usually on the left inside the input box for familiarity.
Accessibility: The search field has an appropriate label for screen readers (e.g. “Search posts in [ProfileName]”). On submit, if no results are found, the results page will indicate “No content found for [query]”.
By providing a direct search, users can quickly navigate the large volume of content that a prolific creator or collective might have. This is crucial in heavy content-use cases – much like one would search within a news site or an academic’s publication list. It improves navigation efficiency, as the user doesn’t have to manually scroll through dozens of posts or rely on external search engines to find something specific on this profile.
Theming and Customization
While the layout and structure remain consistent across profiles for coherence, each profile page allows light customization to reflect the owner’s branding or preferences. This ensures that creators, journalists, and collectives can impart a bit of their identity into the page without breaking the overall design harmony.
Theme and Color: Profiles can define a primary theme or accent color. This color might be used in highlights such as the filter tab indicator, links, buttons, or other accent elements (like the underline of the active tab, or icons). For example, a journalist’s profile could use a conservative dark blue accent, while a creator might choose a vibrant orange. The theme color is applied via CSS variables (e.g. --primary) so that it automatically reflects in all relevant UI elements
github.com
. The rest of the UI uses the standard light/dark mode colors from the design system, ensuring contrast and accessibility (the accent color is tested for contrast against backgrounds or is used in limited areas).
Typography Choice: A limited set of typography options may be offered. Since the base design uses Inter for UI and Source Serif 4 for content by default
github.com
, a profile owner might toggle between a serif or sans-serif style for article text, or choose a different heading font. For instance, an academic might prefer a serif for a more formal look, whereas a tech blogger might stick with sans-serif throughout. This could be implemented as a toggle or selection in settings, applying a CSS class to the profile page that changes font variables. All font sizes and spacing remain per design system; only the font family changes for certain text styles.
Cover Image / Banner: As hinted, an optional cover banner at the top of the profile can add personality. If provided, it appears behind the profile header. The owner can upload an image (with recommended dimensions and aspect ratio for best appearance). The layout will ensure the image is cropped appropriately and doesn’t overpower the header text (for example, a dark overlay or blur might be applied, or simply requiring that the text is placed below the banner). The cover image should align with the theme (e.g. a collective might use a group photo or logo graphic).
Light vs Dark Mode: The entire profile page supports both light and dark mode (inherited from the user’s site theme preference). The profile owner’s accent color should be usable in both modes (the design system would adjust it if necessary, or provide dual values). Content cards, backgrounds, and text all switch to dark mode styles as per global design rules, so a profile page still looks good in dark theme automatically.
Layout Consistency: No structural changes are allowed in customization – e.g., the profile owner cannot move the side panel or reorder sections. This keeps every profile page familiar to users. Customization is intentionally “light” – mostly aesthetic – to maintain usability. The design system enforces accessible color contrasts and font legibility despite customization (for instance, it would prevent setting a white accent on a light background that fails contrast, etc., aligning with WCAG guidelines
github.com
).
From an implementation standpoint, when a profile is rendered, the system will fetch the profile’s theme settings (color, font choice, banner URL). Those get applied at the page layout level, for example by adding a wrapper <div> with inline style or class for the color, and injecting a style tag for the cover image
github.com
. This way, the rest of the components (cards, buttons, etc.) automatically use the configured theme through CSS variables. Developers should ensure these customizations do not break the layout and are limited to approved properties (no arbitrary CSS that could affect layout or critical styles).
Collective Profiles vs Individual Profiles
The layout is fundamentally the same for individual creator profiles and collective profiles, but there are important nuances to support multiple contributors under one profile:
Profile Identity: In a collective profile, the header will display the collective’s name and branding (logo, cover image) as the primary identity. There may be an indication that it’s a collective – for example, a subtle label or description like “An independent publication by XYZ” could be in the bio. For individual profiles, it’s simply the person’s name and portrait.
Content Authors: In the main feed, each post card includes the author’s name in the metadata. On an individual’s profile, this will typically be the profile owner’s name on every post (since they authored all). It might be redundant, but still shown for consistency. On a collective profile, however, the author field is crucial: it will display the contributor who actually created that post, if not the profile owner. The system supports each post having an author_id and an optional collective_id
github.com
, which means the content is published under the collective but attributed to a user. The UI should reflect that by showing “by [AuthorName]” on each card. Author names on collective profiles can link to those individuals’ own profiles if applicable.
Unified Branding: Despite multiple contributors, the overall page maintains a singular thematic identity. The theme color, typography, and overall styling are set by the collective’s owner and apply uniformly. Contributors do not each have their own theme on the collective page – their content is presented in the collective’s style. This reinforces that the profile is one cohesive publication. For example, all posts on a collective might have the same accent color on links or the same card style, even if authors differ.
Microthread Feed for Collectives: The short posts in the side panel would typically be made under the collective’s name. The collective owner or authorized editors might post micro-updates like announcements or quick news. If multiple members can post there, they likely do so on behalf of the collective (potentially the interface might allow tagging the author internally but showing it as the collective). To keep things simple visually, the microthread items on a collective profile can omit individual author names and just assume the collective voice, unless there’s a need to indicate the staff member (which could be included in the text itself if needed).
Pinned Content & Curation: The collective’s owner/editor can pin content just like an individual would, to feature important posts (e.g., a mission statement article or a trending piece). This pinned item could be authored by anyone, but it’s elevated as important to the collective. The ability to curate via pinning and filtering remains with the profile owner to maintain the editorial voice.
Contributors List (optional): While not explicitly required in the prompt, many collective pages include a list or mention of contributors. If included, this could be a small sidebar section or an “About” page accessible from the profile header (e.g., “About this Collective” where members are listed). For the layout spec, we note that if a contributors section is present, it would likely be placed in the side column below the microthread feed or in the header dropdown. It would list member names (possibly with role tags like Editor, Author), but kept minimal to not clutter the main page.
In essence, collective profiles present content from multiple voices under one banner. The design supports this by crediting individual creators at the content level, without detracting from the collective’s overall look and feel. This duality is managed by the metadata in posts and by the profile owner’s control over theme. Development-wise, when rendering a collective profile page, one would query all posts where collective_id equals the profile’s ID (regardless of author) and then display them. The data model’s separation of author and collective
github.com
ensures the front-end can show both the collective context and the author attribution for each piece.
User Flow and Visual Priority
The profile page is designed to guide the user’s attention intuitively and allow efficient navigation through content:
Initial Focus – Header & Pinned Content: When a user lands on the profile, their eyes first catch the Profile Header – the name, avatar, and perhaps the colorful banner or accent elements. This immediately establishes whose page it is. If they’re not already a follower, the follow/subscribe button is readily accessible here. Just below, if a Pinned post exists, it typically has a prominent position. This pinned feature (often a flagship piece of content) will likely draw the user’s attention next, especially if it has an eye-catching title or image. By layout, it sits at the top of the feed, so it’s one of the first content items visible without scrolling.
Scanning the Main Feed: As the user scrolls down the main content column, they encounter a mix of content types in chronological order. The design ensures visual consistency among posts (so a video post isn’t rendered in a completely different style than an article post). This consistency helps users focus on the content itself rather than the format. However, subtle cues (like a play icon on thumbnails or labels like “[Video]” or “[Audio]” in the excerpt) help users identify the type at a glance. The user can scroll and peruse headlines and snippets much like reading a news site’s front page – the hierarchy of typography (larger titles, smaller metadata) and the use of whitespace prevents the page from feeling overwhelming even if dozens of posts are listed.
Using Filter Tabs: If the user has a specific intent (say they only want to watch videos by this creator, or only read articles), their gaze can shift to the Filter Tabs at the top of the feed. The tabs are designed to be easily noticeable (contrasting text and an underline for the active tab). Switching tabs is straightforward and the user flow would be: click a tab -> the feed instantly transitions to show only that content type -> the user scrolls through those items. For example, clicking “Videos” might hide all text-only posts, leaving a list of video thumbnails and titles. This segmented view helps when a user’s in the mood for a particular format.
Attention to the Side Panel: Throughout this experience, the microthread side panel is visible on the right. It’s deliberately less prominent (smaller text, narrower column), but it acts as a peripheral vision element. As the user scrolls the main feed, they might occasionally glance at the side to see if any short update catches their eye – much like seeing a sidebar of recent tweets or live commentary. If something interests them (e.g., a micro-post like “Big news coming tomorrow!”), they can click it or hover. Perhaps clicking a micro-post could open a small overlay with the thread or take them to a dedicated micro-post page; in terms of layout, we just ensure it’s accessible without leaving the profile context drastically. The side feed’s scroll independence means a user could scroll that area to read through micro-posts while the main feed remains static, a parallel browsing experience.
Engaging with Content: Upon seeing a content card of interest, the user can click it to view the full content (e.g. watching the full video or reading the article). This will typically navigate to a new page (the content detail page). The design of the profile page ensures that when the user is done and comes back (or scrolls more), they can easily find where they left off. The chronological ordering and persistent filter state (if they selected a tab, it should remain active when they return) aids in this continuity.
Search Flow: If the user is looking for something specific (say a particular keyword or title they recall), they will use the search bar in the header. The flow: they click the search field, type a query, hit Enter – the page goes to the search results. After viewing results (which may link to content pages), they can use the browser back, or a provided navigation, to return to the main profile. The profile page might not preserve scroll position on return (unless a single-page app behavior is implemented), but since content is chronological, it’s not hard to scroll again. Regardless, the search is a deliberate navigation action taking them temporarily out of the profile page to a results context, so visually it’s distinct.
Visual Hierarchy & Prioritization: Throughout the interface, visual cues guide what to read first:
The profile name and avatar are top-level and bold (establish context).
The pinned content (if any) likely has the largest media or a prominent placement, drawing focus.
Main feed cards then draw attention sequentially; large media thumbnails attract the eye, balanced by text content in each.
The side micro-feed uses less visual weight (smaller font, maybe a subtle border or background) so that it doesn’t compete head-on with the main feed. However, because it might update frequently or have short provocative headlines, it serves as a secondary focal area.
Interactive elements like the filter tabs and the follow button are designed with accent colors, making them easy to find when needed, but subdued enough not to distract when one is simply reading content (for instance, the Follow button is prominent on page load for new visitors, but existing followers might mentally ignore it after that; it doesn’t interfere with content browsing).
The combination of these elements yields a profile page that can be casually browsed like a magazine (scrolling and reading bits of many posts) or purposefully navigated (filtering, searching, diving into specific content). The design handles both use cases gracefully. Readers can spend a long time on the profile page itself, discovering content (thanks to chronological feed and the mix of media). They can also hop in and out (thanks to clear navigation and search). In terms of implementation considerations for this flow: developers should ensure that clicking on content or search doesn’t lose the UI state unnecessarily (e.g., if using a SPA, the filter state can be preserved). Also, performance is key – because this page can be content-heavy, content cards might be loaded progressively, and heavy media like auto-playing many videos should be avoided. Videos could have static thumbnails until clicked, audio players might be just images until needed, etc., to keep the page lightweight on initial load. This preserves the perusability – the user can scroll without lag, quickly scanning many items.
Conclusion
The above specification outlines a comprehensive layout for profile pages that cater to content-rich creators and collectives. The design balances various content types in one unified experience, reflecting the platform’s goal of unifying fragmented media channels

. By combining a rich chronological feed with a realtime micro-update sidebar, users get the depth of a news site and the immediacy of a social feed on a single page. The structure (header, feed, sidebar) and components (cards, tabs, slider, etc.) are described in detail to be implementation-ready, following the project’s design system guidelines for consistency and accessibility. This layout prioritizes readability (through clear typographic hierarchy and single-column main feed), navigation efficiency (filter tabs and search for quick access), and personal/collective identity (via theming and profile info). It is a flexible template that supports individual voices as well as collaborative publications, all while maintaining a coherent user experience. By adhering to this spec, developers and designers can ensure that profile pages are engaging, easy to navigate, and capable of handling a large volume of multimedia content in a professional, organized manner.
