Understood. I will review the entire codebase to determine:

* Whether Supabase Auth Helpers are in use and correctly configured
* If session management aligns with Supabase’s latest best practices (cookie-based SSR support)
* How auth flows (email/password and OAuth) are currently handled and whether they’re functional
* Whether deployment targets (e.g., Vercel Edge runtime) are considered in session persistence
* What changes are necessary to bring your auth stack in line with current Supabase recommendations for Next.js 15 (App Router + RSCs)

I’ll return a detailed modernization plan optimized for Cursor’s agentic code system once the audit is complete.


# Supabase Auth Integration Audit

## Current Integration Summary

The Lnked application uses Supabase for authentication and has integrated the **Supabase Auth Helpers** for Next.js. Key aspects of the current implementation include:

* **Auth Helpers Usage:** The codebase imports and uses `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` (version 0.10.0) to streamline auth in Next.js App Router. For example, the middleware uses `createMiddlewareClient` to instantiate a Supabase client on the Edge runtime, and then obtains the session via `supabase.auth.getSession()`. Similarly, server components use `createServerComponentClient` (wrapped in a helper called `createServerSupabaseClient`), API route handlers use `createRouteHandlerClient`, and client-side components use `createBrowserClient` to initialize Supabase. These helpers abstract away the low-level cookie handling and make the Supabase client available in different Next.js contexts (Edge middleware, Server Components, Route Handlers, and client components).

* **Session Persistence via Cookies:** The auth state is persisted in cookies so that it’s accessible during SSR. In earlier iterations, the code manually managed cookies (using `@supabase/ssr`’s `createServerClient` with `cookies.get()`/`set()` callbacks). This manual handling has been refactored out in favor of the helpers. Now, `createServerSupabaseClient` internally calls `createServerComponentClient({ cookies })`, which uses Next.js cookies under the hood to read/write the `SupabaseAuth` cookies. This replaced the prior `cookieStore.get()` and `cookieStore.set()` logic, simplifying the code and ensuring SSR-safe usage of the session. In other words, when the user logs in, Supabase sets an **access token** and **refresh token** in HttpOnly cookies. Any server-rendered request (via `next/headers`) can read these cookies and authorize Supabase queries on the user's behalf.

* **Sign-in and Sign-up Flows:** The app supports email/password authentication out-of-the-box. There are dedicated client-side pages for **Sign In** and **Sign Up** (`src/app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx` and `sign-up/page.tsx`) which use a singleton Supabase browser client. For example, on **Sign In**, the code calls `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password })` and, on success, redirects the user to `/dashboard` then triggers a `router.refresh()` to update server-side state. The **Sign Up** page similarly calls `supabase.auth.signUp(...)` with email, password, and an additional `full_name` metadata. It handles the possible outcomes (immediate session vs. email confirmation required) – if a session is returned (meaning no email confirmation needed), it shows a success message and navigates to the dashboard; if confirmation is required, it prompts the user to check email. Both flows end by refreshing the Next.js app state, so protected server-rendered content knows about the new session.

* **Auth State Change Callback:** The app implements a crucial piece for SSR synchronization: an auth state change listener on the client that notifies the server of login/logout events. In the `<Navbar>` component (which is client-side), after initializing the Supabase client and retrieving the current user, it sets up `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange`. When a user signs in, signs out, or when the access token is refreshed, this listener is invoked. The handler posts to an internal route (`/api/auth/callback`) with the event type and session object. The server-side [`/api/auth/callback` route](src/app/api/auth/callback/route.ts) receives these events and uses `supabase.auth.setSession()` or `supabase.auth.signOut()` accordingly to update the cookies. This design ensures that after a user logs in on the client, the HttpOnly cookies are set on the server (and cleared on logout) – keeping server-rendered and middleware checks in sync with the client state. (It’s essentially the equivalent of the old `setAuthCookie` utility in previous frameworks, but implemented manually via the Next.js App Router.)

* **Protected Routes via Middleware:** Next.js middleware (`src/middleware.ts`) is used to guard routes under `/dashboard/*`. It creates a Supabase client using the request cookies and immediately calls `supabase.auth.getSession()`. If no session is found, and the user is trying to access a protected page, the middleware issues a redirect to the `/sign-in` page. Conversely (though currently commented out in code), it has logic to redirect authenticated users away from auth pages to avoid showing login forms to logged-in users. The middleware is configured to run on all routes except static assets and public paths, with special focus on the `/dashboard` path pattern. This means any request for a protected page hits the edge function, which checks the cookie-based session and either allows the request to continue (if valid session) or intercepts it with a redirect if not. This works in tandem with the cookie set by the auth callback – if the user has a valid `sb-access-token` cookie, the middleware will find a session and let them in.

* **OAuth Support:** At present, the UI does not explicitly expose OAuth login buttons, but the infrastructure is largely in place to support providers like Google or GitHub. The Supabase client (`supabase.auth`) can initiate OAuth flows (e.g., `signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google' })`), which would redirect the user to the provider and back. Upon return, Supabase JS will detect the URL fragment or query params containing the tokens, update its state, and trigger the same `onAuthStateChange` flow (with `event === "SIGNED_IN"` and a session). The presence of the `/api/auth/callback` endpoint and the onAuthStateChange listener means the app is ready to handle the OAuth response – it will set the cookies and thereby log the user in server-side. In summary, while the codebase focuses on email/password, adding an OAuth login option would mainly involve adding a button in the UI and calling the appropriate Supabase method; the session persistence mechanism would handle the rest. (Supabase’s latest docs provide similar patterns for OAuth via the auth callback route.)

* **Edge Runtime Compatibility:** The design appears mindful of Next.js 13+ and deployment on platforms like Vercel (which run middleware and some functions on the Edge runtime). The use of `next/server` imports (for `NextRequest`/`NextResponse`) and not using Node-specific libraries in those contexts is a good sign. The Supabase helpers themselves use the Fetch API under the hood (compatible with Edge). Environment variables for Supabase URL and anon key are referenced as `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` etc., which Next.js in Edge will inline or make available (since they’re prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`, they are safe to expose). The only potentially non-Edge-safe usage is the Supabase **Admin** client (`supabaseAdmin.ts`), which uses the service role key – but that is only imported in server-only code like API routes (e.g., a Stripe webhook handler) and *not* in middleware or client bundles. For example, the subscription handling route uses `supabaseAdmin` for admin-level queries, but that route runs on the server (Node.js runtime) by default. In short, regular auth flows do not use the service role key on the Edge, and all Edge-executed code (middleware) is using the anonymous key and should be deployable on Vercel’s Edge.

**Bottom line:** The current implementation follows Supabase’s recommended approach for Next.js App Router circa mid-2023 – using `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` for convenience. It properly separates concerns: a client component handles login UI and uses Supabase JS to sign in, an auth state change callback syncs cookies via an API route, middleware protects pages, and server components or API routes can read the session from cookies for SSR. Sessions are stored in secure, HttpOnly cookies (managed by the library), ensuring SSR and RSC (React Server Components) can access the JWT. The code is already using modern Next.js patterns (Route Handlers instead of pages API routes, app directory, React 18+ features).

## Issues & Deviations from Latest Best Practices

While the integration is functional, there are a few areas where it deviates from *the most up-to-date Supabase recommendations* for Next.js 13/15 or could be improved for clarity and future-proofing:

* **Use of Deprecated Package:** The project relies on `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` v0.10.0. According to Supabase, this package is now deprecated in favor of a unified `@supabase/ssr` library. In fact, the lockfile explicitly notes the deprecation: *“please use the @supabase/ssr package instead”*. The repository even has `@supabase/ssr` listed as a dependency, but the current code does not import from it (likely a leftover from previous implementation). Running both packages side-by-side is not recommended, and future updates (bug fixes, new features like future Next.js routing improvements) will land in `@supabase/ssr` only. **Deviation:** Sticking with the deprecated helpers might pose maintenance issues down the line.

* **Cookie Handling is Abstracted (Potential Opaque Behavior):** The auth helper functions hide the implementation of how cookies are read/written. While this reduces boilerplate, it can make it unclear how the session is propagated. Supabase’s latest guidance encourages a more explicit handling using `cookies.getAll()` and `cookies.setAll()` (provided by the `@supabase/ssr` utilities) so that developers are in control of cookie management. In our code, the `createServerSupabaseClient` helper wraps `createServerComponentClient({ cookies })`, which internally calls Next’s cookies. This works, but because it’s abstract, we have to trust the library to manage edge cases (like what happens if a refresh token expires during an SSR render). The **Current Plan** notes in the repo indicate that manual cookie logic was removed in favor of this helper, which is fine, but moving forward the trend is to handle it explicitly via the SSR package’s pattern (especially to support cases like regenerative tokens in Server Actions or edge scenarios). In short, the implementation is correct, but not using the newest `getAll/setAll` interface directly could be seen as a slight deviation from the *very latest* best practices.

* **Auth Callback Route vs. Newer Patterns:** The use of an API route to handle `onAuthStateChange` events (i.e., `/api/auth/callback`) is a recognized approach (documented in Supabase examples for Next.js 13). It ensures that when the client gets new tokens, it tells the server to set them in cookies. This is working as intended. The only call-out is that Supabase’s guidance is evolving towards using **Server Actions** for sign-in and relying on the middleware to set cookies. For instance, a newer approach might be: perform sign-in on the server (so tokens come directly to server) and then use `cookies().set()` to store them, bypassing the need for an extra fetch call. In our case, the client does the sign-in and then calls the server. This is not wrong – it’s actually the recommended solution prior to the introduction of server actions. But given Next.js 15 and React Server Components, one might streamline this by using an `async server action` for logging in (which could call `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword` server-side). That said, this would require the SSR package and a careful cookie handling as well. So, the current design is fine; just note that there’s an emerging pattern to possibly simplify it. **Deviation:** Not really a bug, but an area for modernization (e.g., using server actions for auth could reduce one round-trip).

* **OAuth Flow Implementation:** The infrastructure for OAuth is mostly present, but the app doesn’t currently expose it. This means there’s no direct deviation in terms of code (since it’s simply not used). However, if the goal is to align with Supabase’s recommended usage, one should verify that the OAuth callback URL is configured properly and perhaps implement a route for it if needed. In Supabase’s new SSR approach, you typically don’t even need a special callback page – after redirect, the middleware and auth change callback can handle it. In our case, the `onAuthStateChange` + `/api/auth/callback` covers the use case. We should confirm that the Supabase dashboard’s **Redirect URL** is set to something like `https://your-app-domain.com/` or `.../auth/callback`. Since `emailRedirectTo` in signUp is commented out, it implies email confirmation (if enabled) would go to the default Supabase URL unless configured; likewise for OAuth. **Potential issue:** The app might need a dedicated handling if Supabase were to redirect to an `/auth/callback` route (as a page) after OAuth. Many implementations have a route that calls `supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession()` on the server. The current setup doesn’t show such a page, relying instead on the fact that the Supabase JS client will handle the OAuth response when the user is redirected back to the app’s root or dashboard. This is a subtle point – likely the Supabase client does capture the URL fragment and triggers `onAuthStateChange`. As long as the OAuth provider is configured to redirect back to the app’s domain (and the app loads with the Supabase client active), it will work. But the **latest Supabase docs** often have you add an `/auth/callback` **Route Handler** to consume the query params. We should verify if needed. In summary, supporting OAuth fully might require minor additions (not a fix to existing code, more like an enhancement).

* **Session Propagation on Edge:** One question is whether the session refresh flow is fully edge-compatible. The middleware is an Edge Function by default and it uses `createMiddlewareClient` which in turn uses `NextResponse`. This is designed for edge, so that part is fine. The route handlers run on Node (unless explicitly set to edge), which is also fine. The concern is when an SSR render (server component) occurs on Vercel’s edge – but currently, Next.js does not run Server Components on the edge unless opted-in; they run in regional Node servers. If in the future Next.js allows an Edge SSR for certain routes, one would have to ensure `createServerComponentClient` still works (it likely would, using the same cookies interface). The code as written should be forward-compatible, given that it doesn’t use any Node-only APIs in auth-critical paths. Using `fetch` (which Supabase JS does) and `NextResponse`/`cookies()` is all edge-safe. So this is more of a checkmark: **Is it actually compatible with edge?** – Yes, it appears so, as no deviations were found there. Just ensure environment variables are configured for edge. (One subtle thing: in Edge Runtime, you cannot read process.env directly at runtime; Next.js injects `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` envs into the code bundle. Our use of `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` in the helper should be fine, because it’s used at import time or within functions that Next can statically replace. But if not, the new SSR approach explicitly passes those values in, which is safer.)

* **Minor Typing / DX Issues:** There is a custom TypeScript declaration file for `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` in `src/types/` that declares `createClientComponentClient: any`. This suggests the project may have encountered missing type exports or conflicts (perhaps due to Next 15 and React 19 types). This is a small deviation in that ideally, we shouldn’t need to declare module `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` ourselves. By moving to the new SSR package (which is likely better typed) or updating types, we can eliminate this hack. It’s not a runtime issue, but it indicates the integration wasn’t completely seamless from a types perspective.

In summary, the current setup is largely aligned with recommended practices from the time it was implemented, but to **modernize** for Next.js 13+/15 and Supabase’s latest guidance: we should transition off the deprecated helper package, manage cookies with the new SSR utilities, and consider streamlining the login flow (possibly using server actions or at least cleaning up the auth callback logic). These changes will future-proof the app and resolve any ambiguity around the cookie handling across SSR/Edge.

## Modernization & Migration Plan

To align the codebase with the latest Supabase Next.js patterns (as of Next.js 15 and the evolving App Router ecosystem), we’ll perform a series of refactors. The goal is to remove deprecated usage, make cookie handling explicit and robust, and ensure support for both email/password and OAuth flows is first-class. Below is a step-by-step plan:

**1. Switch to the New Supabase SSR Library** – *Remove deprecated helpers and update dependencies.*

Begin by uninstalling `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` and ensuring `@supabase/ssr` is added (or updated to the latest version). According to Supabase’s migration guide, you should not use both packages together. In `package.json`, remove the auth-helpers package and keep `@supabase/ssr`. For example:

```diff
   "dependencies": {
-    "@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs": "^0.10.0",
+    "@supabase/ssr": "^0.7.0",
     "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.49.4",
     // ...other deps...
   }
```

Run `pnpm install` (or npm/yarn) to apply the changes. This ensures we have the SSR library which contains the replacements for the auth-helper functionality. (Note: The exact version ^0.7.0 is hypothetical; use the latest stable version. At the time of writing, `@supabase/ssr` 0.6.x or above implements the features we need.)

**Why?** The SSR package consolidates all Next.js support (Middleware, Route handlers, etc.) and is the focus of future development. By using it, we get up-to-date methods and can follow Supabase’s official recipes for Next.js 13+. This also resolves the deprecation warning in our lockfile.

After this step, remove any remaining references to `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` in import statements. Our subsequent code changes will replace those with `@supabase/ssr` equivalents.

**2. Refactor Supabase Client Utilities (Server & Browser)** – *Use `@supabase/ssr` to create clients and manage cookies explicitly.*

Supabase’s SSR library does not export one unified “NextClient” like auth-helpers did; instead, it provides lower-level factory functions (`createServerClient`, `createBrowserClient`, etc.) that you call with your URL, anon key, and cookie options. We will create our own wrappers around these for convenience and to keep our code DRY.

* **Update the Browser Client:** In `src/lib/supabase/browser.ts`, replace the import of `createBrowserClient` from auth-helpers with the one from `@supabase/ssr`. The usage will change slightly: previously we called `createBrowserClient<Database>()` with no arguments (auth-helpers was likely picking up env vars internally). Now we need to pass the Supabase project URL and anon key to `createBrowserClient`. For example:

  ```diff
  - import { createBrowserClient } from "@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs";
  + import { createBrowserClient } from "@supabase/ssr";
    import type { Database } from "../database.types";

  - export const createSupabaseBrowserClient = (): SupabaseClient<Database> =>
  -   createBrowserClient<Database>();
  + export const createSupabaseBrowserClient = (): SupabaseClient<Database> =>
  +   createBrowserClient<Database>(
  +     process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  +     process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
  +   );

  const supabase = createSupabaseBrowserClient();
  export default supabase;
  ```

  This explicitly initializes the client with the necessary credentials. It still returns a `SupabaseClient<Database>` as before. The rest of the browser-side usage remains the same (we import `supabase` default or call the function in client components). Supabase JS on the browser will by default persist the session in memory or local storage (unless configured otherwise). We can keep the defaults – the client will store the token and also rely on cookies for server-sync.

* **Update the Server Client Factory:** In `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`, we currently have:

  ```ts
  import { cookies } from "next/headers";
  import { createServerComponentClient } from "@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs";
  import type { Database } from "../database.types";

  export async function createServerSupabaseClient() {
    return createServerComponentClient<Database>({ cookies });
  }
  ```

  We’ll replace this with Supabase SSR’s `createServerClient`. This function signature is: `createServerClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey, { cookies: { getAll, setAll } })`. It does not automatically know about Next.js cookies – we must provide it a way to **read** cookies from the incoming request and **write** cookies to the response. The Next.js `cookies()` API from `"next/headers"` gives us an interface to the incoming cookie store, which has methods to get and set cookies. However, setting a cookie via `cookies()` directly only works in a Server Action or Route Handler (where the response can be modified), and will throw in a pure Server Component (since you can’t set headers during rendering). Supabase’s recommendation is to call `cookies()` and use its methods in a try/catch – if it fails (because of being in a render context), you ignore the set (the middleware will handle refresh token rotation).

  Revise `createServerSupabaseClient` as follows:

  ```ts
  import { cookies } from "next/headers";
  import { createServerClient } from "@supabase/ssr";
  import type { Database } from "../database.types";

  export function createServerSupabaseClient() {
    const cookieStore = cookies();
    return createServerClient<Database>(
      process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
      process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
      {
        cookies: {
          getAll() {
            // Get all cookies from the incoming request
            return cookieStore.getAll();
          },
          setAll(cookiesToSet) {
            // Set cookies on the response (if possible)
            try {
              cookiesToSet.forEach(({ name, value, options }) => {
                cookieStore.set(name, value, options);
              });
            } catch {
              // If in a context that cannot set cookies (e.g. RSC), ignore.
            }
          },
        },
      }
    );
  }
  ```

  Now, `createServerSupabaseClient()` will create a fully configured Supabase client for server-side use, pulling in the request cookies and prepared to set any auth cookies if needed. A few details to note:

  * We no longer mark this function `async` – it’s not necessary to be async since we’re not awaiting anything inside (the old version wasn’t doing any awaits either; it likely was marked async by habit). We simply return the client.
  * The `cookiesToSet` that `supabase.auth` might provide is an array of cookie definitions (with name, value, and options like `Max-Age`, `Path`, etc.). In practice, Supabase sets two cookies: usually `sb-access-token` and `sb-refresh-token`. We loop through and call `cookieStore.set` for each. When this code runs in an API route or Server Action, those cookies will be attached to the outgoing response. If it runs during an SSR render, the `cookieStore.set` will throw (because you can’t set cookies in that context), and we catch and ignore it. This is fine because in SSR, we typically don’t want to mutate state – the token might be expired, but then the middleware (which can set cookies) or a later request would handle refresh. Supabase’s docs confirm that ignoring setAll in non-mutable contexts is acceptable if you have middleware keeping sessions fresh.
  * We use `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!` and key here – since this code runs server-side, we could also use a private service role key for admin actions, but for auth purposes we should use the anon key (matching what the client uses). The service role key is used separately in `supabaseAdmin` for privileged tasks and is never exposed to the client or cookies.

  After this change, anywhere in the code that calls `createServerSupabaseClient()` will be using the new SSR client. It’s important that we remove the old import (`createServerComponentClient`) to avoid confusion or conflicts.

**3. Reimplement Middleware for Session Refresh** – *Ensure edge middleware uses the new cookie utilities to keep sessions in sync.*

Our `middleware.ts` currently uses `createMiddlewareClient` from the old helpers, which internally did something similar to what we set up above (reading request cookies and setting response cookies). We will now replicate this logic explicitly using `createServerClient`. The Supabase migration guide provides a pattern for middleware which we can adapt.

Key points for middleware:

* We need to create a Supabase client with the incoming request’s cookies and also prepare a response object to collect any new cookies.
* We should call an auth method (like `getSession()` or `getUser()`) to trigger any cookie updates (e.g., refresh token rotation).
* Use `NextResponse.next()` with the `{ request }` option to forward the request to the next handler while keeping it modifiable. This gives us a `response` we can attach cookies to.
* After doing auth checks, return this `response` (or a redirect response) as appropriate.

Implement it as follows:

```ts
import { NextResponse, type NextRequest } from "next/server";
import { createServerClient } from "@supabase/ssr";
// import type { Database } from "@/lib/database.types";  // (Optional: if using Database types)
import { Database } from "@/lib/database.types";          // ensure types are available

export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Create a response that we might modify
  let response = NextResponse.next({ request });  // clone the incoming request (incl. cookies) into the response
  // Instantiate Supabase client for this request, with ability to set cookies on the response
  const supabase = createServerClient<Database>(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
    {
      cookies: {
        getAll() {
          return request.cookies.getAll();
        },
        setAll(cookiesToSet) {
          cookiesToSet.forEach(({ name, value, options }) => {
            response.cookies.set(name, value, options);
          });
        },
      },
    }
  );

  // Get the session (triggers refresh if needed)
  const {
    data: { session },
    error,
  } = await supabase.auth.getSession();

  // You can handle error if needed (e.g., log it), but if no session, session will be null.
  const { pathname } = request.nextUrl;
  if (!session && pathname.startsWith("/dashboard")) {
    // User is not logged in and is trying to access a protected route.
    const redirectUrl = request.nextUrl.clone();
    redirectUrl.pathname = "/sign-in";
    return NextResponse.redirect(redirectUrl);
  }

  // If session exists, or route is not protected, just continue. The `response` now contains any 
  // Set-Cookie needed (for refresh token, etc.), which will be sent to the user.
  return response;
}

// (Keep the matcher configuration the same)
export const config = {
  matcher: [
    "/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico|noise.png).*)",
    "/dashboard/:path*",
  ],
};
```

Let’s break down what changed:

* We no longer use `createMiddlewareClient`. Instead, we directly call `createServerClient` with `request.cookies.getAll()` and a custom `setAll` that writes to `response.cookies`. This means if `getSession()` finds that the access token is expired and uses the refresh token to get a new one, the `supabase` client will internally call our `setAll` with updated tokens. We then ensure those updated tokens are added to the outgoing `response` cookies.
* We pass `{ request }` into `NextResponse.next()` when creating the response. This is crucial: it copies the original request’s details (including headers and URL) into the new response, so that if we later modify cookies, we’re modifying *that* response which will continue to the handler. According to Supabase docs, if you create a new NextResponse, you must propagate cookies this way to avoid losing them. Our code does this properly, and uses the same `response` to set cookies.
* The rest of the logic (checking the session and redirecting if not logged in) remains basically the same. We use `pathname.startsWith("/dashboard")` as before. If not authenticated, we redirect to `/sign-in`. If authenticated (or it’s a public page), we return the `response` (which either has some new cookies or not, but importantly, it’s the one we might have modified).
* We should also consider the commented-out logic: if a user is logged in and they hit `/sign-in` or `/sign-up`, you might want to redirect them to `/dashboard`. We can uncomment and use it as needed, adapting to the new `response` object similarly. (It would look like: `if (session && (pathname.startsWith("/sign-in") ...)) return NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/dashboard", request.url));` – and *not* returning `response` in that case, because we want a new redirect. Any auth cookie updates would anyway be in the response we created, but since we’re discarding it for a redirect, we might consider copying those cookies to the redirect as well. However, since a redirect to dashboard will trigger a new request (and the user already has cookies from login), it’s less critical.)

By making this change, our middleware becomes more transparent. It explicitly shows that we take incoming cookies, possibly set new ones (via `setAll`), and always return a `NextResponse`. The **Edge compatibility** is retained: we’re using `NextRequest`, `NextResponse`, and the `request.cookies` interface which works in the Edge runtime. No Node.js APIs are used.

One more subtle improvement: We included `error` in the destructuring of `supabase.auth.getSession()`. In case there’s an error (e.g., network issue or Supabase service down), you might want to handle it. The current code did not check `error`, but logging it could be useful for debugging (not strictly required).

**4. Use the New Server Client in Route Handlers** – *Replace `createRouteHandlerClient` with our unified server client approach.*

All API route handlers under `src/app/api/**` that need access to the authenticated Supabase client should be updated. With auth-helpers, we used `createRouteHandlerClient({ cookies })` to get a Supabase client tied to the request cookies. Now, we can simply call our `createServerSupabaseClient()` (from step 2) inside these handlers. This will achieve the same result: a Supabase client that reads the request’s cookies.

For example, take `src/app/api/like/route.ts` which currently contains:

```ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { cookies } from "next/headers";
import { createRouteHandlerClient } from "@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs";
import type { Database } from "@/lib/database.types";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const supabase = createRouteHandlerClient<Database>({ cookies });
  const {
    data: { user },
    error: authError,
  } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
  if (authError || !user) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "User not authenticated" }, { status: 401 });
  }
  // ... (toggle like logic)
}
```

We refactor it to:

```ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { createServerSupabaseClient } from "@/lib/supabase/server";
import type { Database } from "@/lib/database.types";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const supabase = createServerSupabaseClient();  // our new helper uses cookies internally
  const {
    data: { user },
    error: authError,
  } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
  if (authError || !user) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "User not authenticated" }, { status: 401 });
  }
  // ... proceed with like/unlike using supabase client
}
```

Do this for all similar route handlers (e.g., `posts/route.ts`, `comments/[commentId]/reactions/route.ts`, etc.). They typically follow the pattern of instantiating a client, optionally checking `auth.getUser()` or `auth.getSession()`, then performing some database operations. Replacing the instantiation with `createServerSupabaseClient()` is straightforward.

A few notes on this change:

* Our `createServerSupabaseClient` in `server.ts` uses `cookies()` under the hood. In a Route Handler (which runs on the server), calling `cookies()` will access the request’s cookies automatically. (The Next.js `cookies()` function figures out the context from which it’s called. In a Route Handler, it knows about the incoming Request). So we don’t need to pass `request` explicitly; our helper is self-contained.
* If a route uses `supabase` without needing the user’s session (for instance, maybe an open endpoint that queries public data), it’s still fine to call `createServerSupabaseClient()`. It will include the cookies if any (or none if not present). The Supabase client will operate in either the user’s context or anonymously accordingly. There’s negligible overhead to doing so, and it keeps things uniform.
* With this approach, if Supabase were to refresh a token during one of these route calls, it would try to call `setAll`. In our helper, `setAll` will attempt `cookieStore.set` and catch errors. In a **Route Handler context**, can we set cookies? Actually, as of Next.js 13.4, Route Handlers *do* support setting cookies via the `cookies()` interface (since they’re basically an edge between middleware and full response). However, our implementation might catch and ignore it because we didn’t differentiate contexts. This means if a token refresh happened during an API call, the new token cookie might not get set by this response. This is a corner case – typically, refresh happens in the middleware or on page load, not in the middle of an API call, unless the API call took a very long time or the token expired exactly then. Even if it did, the refresh would succeed but we might not save the new token cookie until the next request’s middleware. This is an acceptable trade-off given complexity. (If we wanted to handle it, we could adopt a similar approach as middleware: create a `NextResponse`, use `createServerClient` with custom `setAll` to attach cookies to that response, and then return the response. But that complicates all handlers for minimal benefit.)
* For routes like `posts/route.ts` that don’t require auth (they just fetch public posts), using `createServerSupabaseClient` is fine – it will just operate with no session and return public data. We might consider calling the Supabase client without auth in those cases (e.g., using `supabaseAdmin` or a separate anon client). However, since `createServerSupabaseClient` essentially gives us an anon client if no session cookie is present, it’s effectively the same as using a plain supabase-js client with anon key. No change needed, and it means if in the future we decide to show user-specific data in those responses, it’ll automatically work if a user is logged in (for instance, an endpoint could return whether the current user liked each post, etc., using RLS policies).

After updating all route handlers, run `pnpm build` or `pnpm typecheck` to ensure you didn’t miss any import and that types line up. The `createServerSupabaseClient` returns a typed `SupabaseClient<Database>` just like the old helpers did, so the rest of your code using it should type-check as before.

**5. Revise the Auth Callback (/api/auth/callback)** – *Make cookie setting explicit in the auth event handler.*

The `/api/auth/callback` route is invoked by our client to sync sessions (on sign-in, sign-out, token refresh). Previously, it used `createServerSupabaseClient()` (from auth-helpers) and called `supabase.auth.setSession(session)` or `supabase.auth.signOut()`. Behind the scenes, those would set or clear cookies via the helper’s mechanism, and Next.js would include those set-cookie headers in the response to the fetch call. Now that we removed auth-helpers, we should reimplement this with our SSR client or directly with the supabase-js client.

One approach: We can actually bypass our `createServerSupabaseClient` here and use the lower-level `createServerClient` directly, providing our own `getAll`/`setAll` tied to a `NextResponse`. This is because we have a very specific need: to send back a response with Set-Cookie headers. The `NextResponse` API allows us to do that easily.

Here’s how to rewrite `src/app/api/auth/callback/route.ts`:

```ts
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { createServerClient } from "@supabase/ssr";
import type { Database } from "@/lib/database.types";
import { cookies } from "next/headers";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  const { event, session } = await request.json();
  // Prepare an empty response we can add cookies to
  const response = NextResponse.json({ status: "success" });
  // Alternatively, to be explicit:
  // const response = new NextResponse(JSON.stringify({ status: "success" }), { status: 200, headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" } });

  // Create a Supabase client that can manipulate cookies
  const cookieStore = cookies();
  const supabase = createServerClient<Database>(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
    {
      cookies: {
        getAll() {
          return cookieStore.getAll();
        },
        setAll(cookiesToSet) {
          cookiesToSet.forEach(({ name, value, options }) => {
            response.cookies.set(name, value, options);
          });
        },
      },
    }
  );

  if (event === "SIGNED_IN" || event === "TOKEN_REFRESHED") {
    await supabase.auth.setSession(session);
  } else if (event === "SIGNED_OUT") {
    await supabase.auth.signOut();
  }

  return response;
}
```

**Explanation:**

* We create a `response` using `NextResponse.json(...)` to have an initial JSON body. We could also construct it manually as shown in the comment. Using `NextResponse.json` is concise and automatically sets the content-type header.
* We then create a Supabase server client with `getAll` reading from the request’s cookies (via `cookies()`) and `setAll` writing to our `response`’s cookies. This is similar to what we did in middleware, but here we didn’t pass `{ request }` to `NextResponse.json` because we want a fresh response (the request’s cookies are accessible via `cookies()` anyway).
* When `supabase.auth.setSession(session)` is called, internally it will call our `setAll` for the access and refresh tokens. That will populate `response.cookies` with the new cookies. Likewise, `signOut()` will call `setAll` to set empty cookies (deleting the tokens).
* We return the `response`, which now contains the JSON `{"status": "success"}` and the Set-Cookie headers. The client (Navbar component) awaits this fetch and doesn’t actually use the JSON payload, but it ensures the request completes so that cookies are set.

This explicit approach ensures that even if we’re on the Edge runtime or a serverless function, the cookies are properly attached. It also decouples us from the auth-helpers internal cookie logic.

One subtlety: We use `cookies()` from `next/headers` at the top. In a Route Handler, this gives us a `RequestCookies` object for the incoming request. Arguably, we might not even need to read incoming cookies here at all – we could pass an empty array to getAll, because for setting a session we only care about writing cookies, not reading. For signOut, we might want to know the refresh token to revoke it – but `supabase.auth.signOut()` with the service role or anon key might not actually revoke refresh tokens (it just clears client state). It’s fine to leave getAll as is (it doesn’t hurt to include it).

With this change, when the user logs in or out on the client:

* The client calls `/api/auth/callback` with the new session or a null session.
* This handler will set the appropriate cookies (`sb-access-token` and `sb-refresh-token`).
* The response goes back to the client (with status: success which we ignore). The important part is the cookies are now set in the browser.
* Subsequent SSR or middleware will see `session` cookies present and the user is considered logged in. This achieves the same end result as before, just via our own implementation.

**6. Test and Adjust OAuth Flow (if needed):** With these changes, the fundamental session mechanism is solid for both email/password and OAuth, but we should double-check the OAuth setup:

* **Supabase Configuration:** Ensure that in your Supabase Project Settings, under **Authentication -> URL Configuration**, you have your app’s base URL or callback URL listed. For example, you might add `https://yourdomain.com/auth/callback` or simply `https://yourdomain.com/*` as allowed redirect URLs. This ensures that when Supabase completes an OAuth sign-in, it can redirect to your application.

* **Callback Handling:** If Supabase directs the OAuth response to a specific route (like `auth/callback`), you would typically handle that by either:
  a) catching it on the client (Supabase JS will parse the URL fragment), or
  b) having a Next.js Route Handler to capture the provider’s redirect query params. The current code doesn’t have a dedicated page for OAuth callback – it relies on the client being loaded and `onAuthStateChange` firing. That will work if the OAuth redirect goes to a page where our Navbar (with supabase client) is mounted (e.g., the home page or dashboard).

  If we wanted to be very explicit, we could create an `/auth/callback` **page** that runs on the client and simply calls `supabase.auth.exchangeCodeForSession()` (for PKCE flows) or checks `auth.getSession()`. However, Supabase’s JS SDK should handle this automatically when the page loads, so long as the URL contains the `access_token` fragment or code. In practice: after OAuth login on the provider side, Supabase will redirect back to something like `https://yourapp.com/#access_token=<...>&refresh_token=<...>` (for implicit flow) or a code (for PKCE).

  Supabase JS, when initialized, will detect those in the URL and handle them. It should then trigger `onAuthStateChange` with a new session. Our listener will fire and call the callback route to set cookies. So the existing mechanism should suffice. Just ensure that the user is redirected to a route that loads the Supabase client. For example, maybe redirect to the dashboard or home. Often, developers set the redirect URL to the root (`/`), and since our root page doesn’t instantiate Supabase (no Navbar there, as it’s mostly a landing), we might miss the event. One solution is to set the OAuth redirect to `/dashboard` (which is protected – if the user isn’t logged in yet, our middleware would normally redirect them, but in this OAuth case, they’ll be carrying tokens in the URL).

  A safer approach: we could create a simple page at `/auth/callback` whose only job is to initialize a Supabase client (maybe using a client component) and then navigate the user. However, since our Navbar is null on auth pages (we hide Navbar on `/sign-in` and `/sign-up` via `if` in Navbar), if we had a standalone `/auth/callback` page, we might need to temporarily show a loader.

  This is an edge scenario outside the core integration; the main integration (cookie, session handling) is ready for OAuth. Implementing the UI/UX for it (buttons and possible callback page) is the remaining step.

* **Add OAuth Buttons:** To actually support OAuth login, you’d add buttons in the Sign In page (or a dedicated section) to trigger `supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google' })` or `'github'`, etc. For instance, you might use the Supabase JS client on the client-side:

  ```jsx
  const handleOAuthSignIn = async () => {
    const { error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: "google" });
    if (error) console.error("OAuth sign-in error:", error);
    // Supabase will redirect to Google, so no further action needed here on success.
  };
  ```

  Once the user completes Google OAuth and is redirected back, the process described above will set the session cookies.

* **Testing:** After implementing the above, test the following scenarios:

  * Regular email/password login: ensure that after login, cookies `sb-access-token` and `sb-refresh-token` are set (check Application > Cookies in the browser dev tools), and that a server-side fetch (like reloading the dashboard page) recognizes the user (no redirect to sign-in, and maybe the UI shows user’s name, etc.). Also test logout: clicking logout should remove those cookies (they might remain with empty value or just disappear) and trigger middleware to redirect if you try a protected page.
  * OAuth login: using a configured provider (Google, etc.), click the sign-in. After redirecting back, ensure the cookies are set and the user is treated as logged in. This might require playing with redirect URLs as mentioned.
  * Token refresh: you can simulate or wait for the access token to expire (Supabase tokens by default last 1 hour). The Supabase client should automatically refresh it at the 50-minute mark. To test our server handling: you could shorten the JWT expiry in Supabase settings and observe if our middleware or any route calls result in `setAll` being invoked. The middleware will call `getSession()` on every request; if the token is expired, Supabase will use the refresh token to get a new one. Our `setAll` in middleware will then set the new cookies via `response.cookies.set`. We return that response, so the updated cookie goes to the browser. This ensures continuous sessions. Essentially, our middleware is now doing what the auth-helper’s middleware client did – it refreshes tokens on the fly and persists them. This is crucial for long-lived sessions on Edge.

**7. Clean Up and Final Notes:**

* **Remove leftover types and imports:** The custom type declaration for the old auth-helper can be removed (`src/types/@supabase-auth-helpers-nextjs.d.ts`). It’s no longer needed. Also, search for any import lines referencing `auth-helpers-nextjs` to ensure none remain.

* **Verify TypeScript Types:** Our usage of `createServerClient` and `createBrowserClient` should be type-safe. We passed `<Database>` which ensures the returned client is typed to our schema. This means calls like `supabase.from("posts").select(...` will still be type-checked against the schema. If you run `pnpm typecheck` and encounter any issues (for example, if the SSR package’s types differ slightly), address them. In particular, ensure that our `createServerSupabaseClient()` helper’s return type is correctly inferred as `SupabaseClient<Database>`. We might explicitly annotate it for clarity:

  ```ts
  export function createServerSupabaseClient(): SupabaseClient<Database> {
    // ...
  }
  ```

  Similarly, ensure the `supabase` default export in `browser.ts` remains a `SupabaseClient<Database>`.

* **Cookie Names & Security:** The cookies set by Supabase (`sb-access-token` and `sb-refresh-token` by default) remain the same after these changes. We did not override the cookie names or settings, so they will be HTTPOnly, Secure, with the same path and expiration rules Supabase uses by default. Typically:

  * `sb-access-token` is a short-lived cookie (expires in an hour or whatever your JWT expiry is).
  * `sb-refresh-token` lasts longer (usually 1 week) to allow reauthentication.
  * Both are HTTPOnly, Secure (in production), and scoped to your domain. They might also be `SameSite=Lax` by default, which is fine for our use (we’re not sending these cookies cross-site, only first-party).

  We should double-check in a dev environment that after login, `document.cookie` does **not** show these cookies (since HttpOnly means JavaScript can’t read them), and that the network tab shows them being sent on requests to our domain. This ensures security (no XSS can steal the tokens) and proper server availability.

  If we wanted to rename these cookies or tweak settings (e.g., `SameSite=None` for some reason), `CookieOptions` could be provided in `supabase.auth.setSession` calls. But there’s no need; the defaults are recommended by Supabase and are what we’re using.

* **Server/Client Demarcation:** After migration, the responsibilities are:

  * **Server (via SSR package):** Maintains the source of truth for the session in cookies. Middleware and API routes use the refresh token to keep the session valid, and protect content. The server never stores session data in memory – it always pulls from cookies (and potentially refreshes via Supabase).
  * **Client (Supabase JS):** Provides a convenient API for user actions (login, logout, sign up) and real-time updates (onAuthStateChange). It stores the session in memory (and/or local storage) so the client UI knows a user is logged in without always making a network call. However, this is secondary; the true session is in the cookies for SSR. Our implementation ensures that whenever the client state changes, it informs the server (cookies) immediately. The client does not attempt to persist the session to its own cookies or anything – it defers that to our `/api/auth/callback`.

  This separation means we don’t rely on `localStorage` for critical security, which is good. Even if a malicious JS snippet ran, it couldn’t hijack the tokens (HttpOnly). The worst it could do is call our logout or login functions, which are guarded by the same supabase-client rules.

* **Edge Deployment Consideration:** With the use of `@supabase/ssr`, our code should continue to work on Vercel Edge Functions. The middleware is definitely edge (as before). The route handlers by default run in Node (not edge). If we wanted, we could mark some routes with `export const runtime = "edge"` to run them on edge as well. Our code in them should be edge-compatible, since we eliminated Node-specific code. However, note that Vercel Edge currently does not support certain Node modules (like the `pg` driver or some crypto modules). Supabase JS uses the Fetch API and should be fine. If performance or locality is needed, we could try moving read-only routes to edge.

  One caveat: environment variables in edge. `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in an edge function is actually inlined at build time (since it’s public). That’s okay. If we ever needed to use a secret (which we don’t in edge code now), we’d have to use a different mechanism or not run that on edge.

* **Logging and Monitoring:** It might be helpful to add some `console.log` or `console.error` statements in the auth flow for debugging in development. For example, logging if `authError` occurs in route handlers, or if `error` comes from `supabase.auth.getSession()` in middleware. In production, you might integrate with a logging platform. Since our focus is the integration, just keep in mind to monitor these flows (especially the token refresh, which can be tricky).

* **Final QA:** After making all these changes, comprehensively test the flows:

  * Sign up new user -> confirm email (if email confirmations on) -> sign in -> access pages.
  * Sign in existing user -> refresh page -> navigate around -> no unexpected logouts.
  * Let a session expire (you can shorten the JWT expiry for testing) -> verify that a request to a protected page triggers a refresh (maybe log something in middleware when `session` is null but `refresh_token` exists to see if it becomes non-null after `getSession()`).
  * Sign out -> ensure cookies are cleared and protected page redirects to login.
  * (If using OAuth) test OAuth login flow end-to-end as mentioned.

This migration plan brings the project in line with Supabase’s latest Next.js guidance. We’ve removed deprecated APIs and made the auth mechanism more transparent. The session cookie system is now explicitly managed via `getAll/setAll` as recommended, ensuring **SSR-safe session persistence** across RSC, middleware, and route handlers. The app supports email/password and is ready for OAuth with minimal additions. By handling cookies at the Next.js response level, we’ve ensured compatibility with **Edge Runtime** deployment on Vercel, while maintaining secure, HttpOnly token storage and clear separation of server vs client auth responsibilities. The result is a modern, robust authentication setup for Next.js 15 and beyond, using Supabase as the backbone.
