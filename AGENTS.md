Implement Multi-Column Responsive Reading Layout
Files: src/app/(public)/posts/[slug]/page.tsx (post reading page), possibly globals.css or Tailwind config for additional utilities
Action: Update the post article layout to span multiple columns on large screens for an editorial reading experience. In the post view component, adjust the container classes to allow wider layouts and use CSS columns for text content. For example, increase the max width for the content container:
diff
Copy
Edit
- <div className="container mx-auto max-w-3xl p-4 md:p-6">  
+ <div className="container mx-auto max-w-3xl xl:max-w-6xl p-4 md:p-6">  
This lets the article expand to a larger width on extra-large screens (e.g. up to ~1200px). Then, target the content wrapper that currently holds the rendered post (the <div className="prose ..."> around <LexicalRenderer>
github.com
) and add multi-column classes:
diff
Copy
Edit
- <div className="prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl max-w-none">  
+ <div className="prose dark:prose-invert lg:prose-xl max-w-none xl:columns-2 xl:gap-8">  
This uses Tailwindâ€™s columns-2 utility to flow text in two columns on xl screens, with a gap between columns for readability. Ensure images and embeds are responsive within columns (they already have max-width: 100% via Next/Image
github.com
, so they will shrink to column width as needed). Optionally, enable CSS property column-fill: balance; on that container (via a utility or custom CSS) so the two columns are filled more evenly.
Action: Enable automatic hyphenation for better text flow in columns. In globals.css or as a Tailwind plugin, add hyphens: auto (and overflow-wrap: break-word) to the .prose class or article content class. This prevents overly large words or URLs from breaking the column layout and improves readability by hyphenating long words across line breaks.
Intent & Impact: On wide desktop screens, posts will now render in a multi-column magazine-style format, reducing line length for easier reading. Readers on large monitors will see text in two balanced columns, giving a professional editorial feel similar to print layouts. On smaller devices, the layout gracefully falls back to a single column. This responsive design enhances readability and visual appeal without affecting mobile users.
