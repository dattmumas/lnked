Enhance User Profile Page with Full Details & Featured Content: Update the user profile route (src/app/users/[userId]/page.tsx) to display a comprehensive profile header. Currently it shows the user's name and bio
github.com
, but we should add the user’s avatar and any other public info. Fetch avatar_url (profile image) along with full_name, bio, and tags from the users table
github.com
 and include these in the page’s data. In the JSX header, render an avatar image (using an <Image> or existing Avatar component) next to the name, and list the user’s interests/tags if available (e.g. as badges or comma-separated text). Also, retrieve follower and subscriber counts for this user: for example, query the follows table for following_id = userId with count: 'exact' to get number of followers, and the subscriptions table for active subscriptions where target_entity_type = 'user' and target_entity_id = userId for subscriber count. Display these counts in the profile header (e.g. "123 followers – 10 subscribers") so that they update in real-time after follow/subscribe actions. Ensure this header respects privacy toggles – since profiles are public by default, just avoid showing any private info. Use existing styling (Tailwind and UI components) for consistency, and do not introduce new UI libraries (continue using the design system in place).
