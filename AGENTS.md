Extend Radix UI Integration for Consistent Components
Files: src/components/app/dashboard/organisms/UserMenu.tsx, src/components/editor/EmbedUrlModal.tsx, any new dropdowns/menus
Action: Adopt Radix UI primitives for interactive components to ensure accessibility and consistency. Identify places where a custom implementation could be improved by Radix. For example, the user profile menu in the dashboard is currently just a placeholder button
github.com
. Replace this with a Radix DropdownMenu: use @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu to create a menu with items like “My Profile”, “Account Settings”, “Sign Out”. The Radix DropdownMenu comes with full keyboard navigation and focus management out of the box. You can style it using the same Tailwind approach as other Radix components (e.g., using data-[state=open] attributes for transitions or our design tokens for colors). This will match the style of the mobile nav sheet and improve UX (e.g., pressing Enter or Space on the username button will open a menu instead of immediately logging out as it does now).
Action: Use Radix Dialog for modal interactions if any custom modals exist. The Embed URL modal is currently a custom div with role="dialog"
github.com
. We can switch this to a Radix <Dialog> for more robust handling of focus trap and accessibility. Wrap the modal content in <DialogContent> and use <DialogOverlay> for the backdrop, instead of manually managing key events and focus. Style these with Tailwind to look identical to the current design (Radix will provide ARIA attributes and manage returning focus on close automatically). For example, use Dialog.Title for the label instead of a <label> outside the context (ensuring screen readers announce it properly). This isn’t an urgent change since the custom modal already handles basics, but it aligns with our use of Radix for consistency.
Action: Apply Radix where appropriate for any other floating UI: tooltips (Radix Tooltip for things like icon explanations), popovers (for the new floating toolbar perhaps, though we implemented that custom – which is okay since it’s deeply tied to editor selection). The idea is not to rewrite everything, but to ensure we leverage Radix’s accessible components for common patterns like menus, dialogs, tooltips, where we gain reliability. We’ve already successfully integrated Radix for the mobile menu sheet
github.com
 and we style it with Tailwind classes, so extending that pattern to new components will maintain a cohesive look and feel across the app.
Intent & Impact: By deepening the Radix UI integration, we standardize the behavior of menus and dialogs, reducing custom code and ensuring all interactive components meet the same accessibility standards. Users will notice that things like dropdown menus and popups behave consistently – focus is managed predictably, keyboard controls work everywhere, and the styling is uniform. This consistency builds user trust in the interface. It also improves maintainability: using Radix’s well-tested primitives means fewer edge-case bugs (like focus getting lost or unexpected scroll locking issues), so the navigation and dialog interactions will be smooth and bug-free across browsers.
