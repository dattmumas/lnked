Step 2: Create an (auth) group with a minimal layout for Sign-In/Sign-Up
Scope: Introduce a dedicated route group for authentication pages (login and registration), ensuring they have a streamlined layout. The goal is to remove these pages from the main public layout context, so we can simplify their UI (e.g. no main site nav or footer cluttering the login screen) and control their metadata separately. We will add a lightweight (auth)/layout.tsx.
Affected Files:
Ensure the sign-in and sign-up pages are located under src/app/(auth)/ – the code already has src/app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx and sign-up/page.tsx which import client components

, so they’re already in the correct group. Now create src/app/(auth)/layout.tsx. This layout should be minimal: for example, it might include just a centered container or a simple brand header. We will not include the standard <Navbar> here (to avoid login page showing the full site menu). If desired, we can add a small link to go back to home or a logo for branding, but no primary nav or footer.
Remove any remaining nav/footer inclusion for auth pages from the root or public layouts. After Step 1, our RootLayout no longer added a nav, so the sign-in page currently would have shown no header at all (since it wasn’t under public). We can improve that by adding a very simple header in the (auth) layout (e.g. an app logo or “Lnked” title linking to home, to maintain visual consistency). This (auth) layout can also wrap the children in a centered <main> with some padding, so that the auth form card isn’t stuck to the top.
Verify that the <AuthForm> component and pages don’t assume a specific layout. The auth pages should now automatically use (auth)/layout.tsx (since they are under that group) instead of the root/public layout.
Test Updates: Check tests related to authentication flows. For instance, an e2e test that loads the sign-in page expects the heading “Sign In” to be visible

. That should remain true, since our auth layout won’t interfere with the content of the sign-in page – it only removes extraneous nav elements. If any test was asserting that the main navigation is present on the sign-in page (unlikely, as typically you wouldn’t require a nav on a login screen), update it to reflect the new minimal layout (e.g. expect not to see the nav links on sign-in). Also, tests that simulate switching between sign-in and sign-up should still find the “Don’t have an account? Sign Up” link provided by <AuthForm>

 – that link remains within the form card and is unaffected by the layout change. Run the auth-related tests to ensure nothing is broken.
Expected Outcome: The login and registration pages are isolated in their own route group with a clean layout. When a user visits /sign-in or /sign-up, they see a focused authentication form (and perhaps a small branded header), without the main site navigation. This aligns the UI with common practices and avoids confusion (e.g. no “Dashboard” button on a login screen). The site’s public and authenticated sections are now more clearly delineated by their layouts. At this point, we’ve removed all redundant header/footer elements from auth pages, and all tests should continue to pass (or be adjusted to the intended behavior).
