Extend Profile Editing Form for Avatars and Additional Fields: Modify the Edit Profile form (src/app/dashboard/profile/edit/EditProfileForm.tsx) to allow updating profile media and any new fields. Currently the form handles full name, bio, and tags

. Add an input for uploading a profile picture: for example, include a file input field labeled "Profile Image". Use a controlled component or a custom file upload component (if one exists) to let users select an image file. You might incorporate a preview of the chosen image in the form for better UX. Validate the file type/size on client side if possible (to ensure it’s an image and not too large). Additionally, if you plan to allow changing other profile info (like a custom username or social links), include those fields here as well. Use the existing form structure with react-hook-form and Zod schema to handle the new field: update the Zod schema to include avatar (perhaps as a file or data URL string) and any other added fields. For example, you can extend the ClientUserProfileSchema to accept an optional file (or a string URL after upload). Keep the UI consistent: perhaps use a small preview avatar component and a Change button that triggers file selection. Since we want to avoid ShadCN boilerplate beyond what’s already used, utilize the existing <Input> or <Button> components styled with Tailwind where appropriate. Ensure that adding this file input doesn’t break the layout – wrap it in the same <CardContent> section as the other fields and handle validation errors similarly (e.g., if the image is too large, show an error message under the field). By the end of this step, the profile edit form will let users update their avatar along with name/bio, improving the “full profile” experience.
