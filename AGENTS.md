Task 9: Performance Optimization & Security Audit
Goal: Optimize the application for speed and security. Remove any development artifacts (like verbose logging), improve performance of critical paths, and ensure that the app follows security best practices (especially around authentication and sensitive data).
Scope & Actions:
Remove Debug Logs: Search and eliminate console.log or console.debug statements that are not necessary in production. For example, in middleware.ts there are multiple console logs for session checks
github.com
and even Supabase keys being printed on server startup
github.com
. These should be removed or guarded (e.g., only log in development mode). Exposing secrets or internal state in logs is risky and can clutter real-time logs. Clean up the slash menu plugin’s logs as well (it currently logs key presses and selection info
github.com
). After this, the server and client console output should be clean and only output errors or important info deliberately.
Authenticate & Authorize Everywhere: Audit all API routes and server actions to ensure they verify user identity and permissions. Many routes likely rely on Supabase RLS, but double-check logic. For instance, the comments API (POST /api/posts/[postId]/comments) should require a logged-in user – if not already, add a check for session in those route handlers (similar to what’s done in other routes). Ensure that delete or update routes (if any exist for posts, comments) check that the requesting user is the owner or has proper role. On the client side, verify that protected UI elements (like the “Edit” button on a post) only render for authorized users to prevent broken flows.
Optimize Database Queries: Review any expensive data operations. If certain pages pull a lot of data (e.g., the “Discover” page recommendations), make sure they use efficient queries or pagination. The recommendations fetch already uses caching (revalidate: 300 on the request)
github.com
. Extend this principle to other data: e.g., if the landing page or discover page content doesn’t change per request, use Next’s ISR (export const revalidate = ...) to cache it on the server. Conversely, ensure highly dynamic data (like dashboard stats) are not cached incorrectly – use cache: 'no-store' or similar for truly real-time data.
Bundle Size and Loading Performance: Check the client bundle size using Next.js analysis. Large dependencies like Excalidraw or Lucide icon set could impact initial load. Implement code-splitting or lazy loading for features not used immediately. For example, load the Lexical editor code only on routes that need it (the editor is probably already only in the dashboard/post pages, but confirm it’s not in the main bundle for public pages). You might use dynamic imports for heavy components like the editor, Excalidraw, or charts on the analytics page. This will improve the landing page and other public pages’ load time.
Security Headers & Misc: Consider adding HTTP headers to enhance security (if not handled by Next/Vercel by default). For instance, use next.config.js to set Content Security Policy (CSP), Strict-Transport-Security, etc., or at least verify that Vercel’s defaults are sufficient. Also ensure cookies (like the Supabase auth cookie) are sent with Secure and HttpOnly flags – Supabase library should handle this, but verify. Finally, double-check that no sensitive information is exposed in the client (e.g., ensure the service_role key is never sent to the client – as noted in supabaseAdmin.ts, it should only be used server-side
github.com
, and our code respects that). By completing this audit, the app will be leaner, faster, and safer for launch.
