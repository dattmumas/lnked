Action: Create a new layout component for editor routes that includes the main site header and <Navbar /> (similar to PublicLayout). This ensures the navigation bar renders on pages like the new post editor (currently missing because editor routes don’t use the public layout). For example, mimic PublicLayout’s structure by wrapping editor page content with a <header> containing the logo and <Navbar />

. In Next.js App Router, each route group needs its own layout to share common UI; adding an Editor layout will fix the navbar not rendering on those pages.
Action: In globals.css, define styles for multi-column editor containers to lay groundwork for the new layout. Add CSS for .layout-container and .layout-item (used by Lexical’s column nodes) to display as a responsive two-column grid. For instance:
css
Copy
Edit
.layout-container { display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr; gap: 1.5rem; }  
@media (min-width: 768px) { /* large screens */  
  .layout-container { grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); }  
}  
.layout-item { /* acts as a column */ }  
This will initially stack items on mobile and show two columns on desktop. (Alternatively, use Tailwind utilities like grid cols-1 md:cols-2 gap-6 on those elements.) This styling “turns on” the editor’s Columns Layout feature so that when authors insert a two-column layout, the items actually appear side by side.
Intent & Impact: Fixes the navbar bug – the nav bar will now consistently render on all pages (public, dashboard, and editor) by providing a layout wrapper for editor routes. It also establishes the base for multi-column layouts, enabling editorial content to be structured in multiple columns (both in-editor and in the output) going forward. Users will regain navigation on editor pages and can start using column blocks in their posts with proper styling.
