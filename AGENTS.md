Display Follower Counts and Followers List: Augment both user and collective profiles to show follower information. After implementing follow mechanics, fetch the count of followers for the profile and display it prominently. For example, in users/[userId]/page.tsx, after loading the profile, run a Supabase query on the follows table: .from('follows').select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true }).eq('following_id', userId) to get the number of followers (where following_id is the profile’s ID)

. Do the same for collectives (with following_id = collective.id). Render these counts in the profile header (e.g., next to the subscribe/follow buttons or under the bio). You could format it like “234 followers” (and optionally make it a link). For a richer experience, implement a modal or dedicated page to list followers. For instance, clicking the follower count could open a small <Dialog> or navigate to /users/[userId]/followers where you list followers’ names. To get the list, query follows for rows where following_id = profileId and select the follower’s user details (a join on users table by follower_id). Ensure that for collective profiles, you handle follower listing similarly (target type will differentiate user vs collective follows). Use the user’s name and maybe avatar in the list, each linking to that follower’s profile. Privacy consideration: If profiles or follower relationships can be private, enforce that here (e.g., only show mutual followers if required by settings), but since such toggles are not explicitly in schema, assume all followers are public info for now. By providing follower counts (and possibly lists), users can gauge engagement on profiles, and this step uses only existing data (the follows table) so it doesn’t break anything – we’re carefully reading from follows which we already use for follow logic
