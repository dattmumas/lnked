Apply Vibrant Accent-on-Gray Theme Updates
Files: src/app/globals.css, tailwind.config.ts
Action: Intensify the accent color and usage in the theme to achieve a vibrant-accent-on-gray design. Adjust the design tokens in globals.css for the accent color to make it more saturated or prominent against the neutral background. For example, if the current --accent is defined as oklch(0.72 0.15 203)

, increase the chroma component (second value) or adjust hue to a bolder variant (e.g., oklch(0.72 0.25 203)) for a richer accent. Ensure the contrast with --background (light gray) is sufficient for accessibility.
Action: Use the accent color more deliberately across UI elements. Update Tailwind config and component styles so that interactive or highlighted elements use the accent. For instance, in tailwind.config.ts under the Typography plugin settings, change link colors to the accent:

typography: {
  DEFAULT: {
    css: {
-      a: { color: "hsl(var(--primary))", "&:hover": { color: "hsl(var(--primary) / 0.8)" } },
+      a: { color: "hsl(var(--accent))", "&:hover": { color: "hsl(var(--accent) / 0.8)" } },
       ...  
    }
  }
}
Currently, links in articles use the primary color

; switching to accent will make them stand out with the new vibrant hue. Similarly, update any buttons or focus states that should draw attention – e.g. use bg-accent and text-accent-foreground for primary call-to-action buttons, and use accent for focus rings (--ring is already tied to primary which we can align with accent)

.
Action: Embrace gray for surfaces, accent for highlights. Audit UI components (cards, nav, sidebar) to ensure their backgrounds are neutral (gray/white from the design tokens) and the accent color is used for key highlights (active states, selection, brand mark, etc.). For example, maintain the background as the --background token (a nearly white gray) and use accent for things like the logo dot, icons, or selection highlights. The theme already defines a neutral “card” background and foreground

 – continue leveraging those, but wherever a pop of color is needed (links, highlight text, or important icons), apply the accent color class.
Intent & Impact: These changes will refine the UI to have a consistent modern theme: mostly calm gray tones with a single vibrant accent color drawing the eye. The platform’s design will feel more cohesive and visually engaging. Users will notice interactive elements and highlights more clearly (thanks to the bolder accent), while the overall interface retains a clean, minimalist gray backdrop. This improves both aesthetic appeal and usability (through better contrast and consistent theming).
