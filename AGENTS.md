Redesign Typography Hierarchy and Readability
Objective: Improve text readability and establish a clear hierarchy with appropriate font choices and sizes.
Summary: Overhaul the typography system to use larger, more readable fonts for body content and clear distinctions for headings and UI text. We will use a serif font for body text (to emulate a traditional newsprint feel) and a modern sans-serif for UI elements (navigation, buttons, labels) for contrast. Currently, the project already includes Inter (sans) and Source Serif as font families
github.com
, with headings in serif and other text in sans by default
github.com
. We will adjust base font sizes and line-heights to ensure comfortable reading (e.g. slightly larger body font and increased line-height for dense text blocks). Headings will be sized to create a strong visual hierarchy and use consistent font-weight (e.g. heavy for titles). Using Tailwind’s typography plugin, we’ll customize the styles for prose: for example, set paragraph text to the serif font and maybe a bit larger, while UI continues to use sans. We’ll also audit anywhere text appears too small or lacks contrast and adjust via utility classes or theme (for instance, ensure muted or secondary text is still legible). Overall, body text will have a more spacious line spacing (around 1.6) and headings/titles will stand out with distinct sizing. These changes will make content feel more like a clean, modern newspaper.
Key Files/Components: Tailwind config (tailwind.config.ts) to adjust the theme’s font families and font sizes if needed. We may define new custom font sizes or use Tailwind’s default scale appropriately. The global stylesheet or layout (e.g. globals.css) to set a base font for the body. Tailwind Typography plugin configuration in tailwind.config.ts (under typography extend) to ensure paragraphs use serif and the desired style. For example, if needed, add p: { fontFamily: theme('fontFamily.serif'), ... }. Check UI components in src/components/ui/* for any hardcoded font classes and ensure they use the proper font (sans for buttons, forms, etc.).
Codex Best Practices: Apply changes in a modular way: first update the config and base styles, then adjust individual components if needed. Test across various pages to see the effect (especially reading a long post vs. using the dashboard UI). Use atomic commits for distinct sub-tasks (e.g. “feat: increase base font size and line-height for posts”). In commit messages and PR descriptions, explain the rationale (e.g. “Using serif for body text improves long-form readability”). Verify accessibility – although we are softening contrast in the theme (next step), ensure that the font size and weight choices still meet accessibility guidelines (contrast and size for readability). Where possible, get feedback or do quick user tests on the new typography to ensure it achieves the desired effect before proceeding.
Establish Soft Neutral Theme & Design Tokens
Objective: Introduce a modern, soft-color design theme and implement a unified design token system for colors and spacing.
Summary: Update the global color palette to reduce harsh black/white contrast, using soft neutrals (grays, beiges) and subtle accent colors. The current light theme already uses an off-white background and near-black text
github.com
, but we will refine this further: for example, introduce a slight warm beige or gray tone to backgrounds (--background) instead of pure white, and use a dark gray for text (--foreground) instead of pure black to reduce eye strain. Accent colors (used for links, highlights, etc.) will be used sparingly – we might choose one primary accent (e.g. a subdued blue or earthy tone) and ensure it’s applied consistently for interactive elements. We will update the CSS custom properties in globals.css to the new palette (for both light and dark mode), and adjust Tailwind config if needed to extend any new semantic colors. In tandem, we’ll solidify the design token system for spacing and sizing. The code already defines CSS variables for colors and some radii, but spacing tokens are not fully utilized (there’s a comment about using an 8px grid)
github.com
. We will define a scale of spacing values (e.g. base unit 4px, but prefer multiples of 8px for consistent rhythm) and incorporate them either as Tailwind spacing scale or as CSS custom properties (e.g. --spacing-sm: 8px, --spacing-md:16px, etc.). These tokens will be used in our components and layouts to ensure consistent padding/margins throughout. By centralizing colors and spacing in tokens, we make the design easier to tweak globally. After introducing the new soft color values, we will audit UI components for any places where colors are hardcoded or not using the theme (e.g. ensure all background uses bg-background, borders use border-border, etc., so they automatically get the new tones). The end result is a more subdued, “modern newspaper” aesthetic: soft background, gentle contrast, and a cohesive color scheme with occasional pops of color via the accent.
Key Files/Components: src/app/globals.css where the :root variables for colors are defined (we’ll update values like --background, --foreground, --muted, etc. to new Oklch or HEX values representing off-whites and grays)
github.com
. tailwind.config.ts to ensure the Tailwind theme uses these CSS vars for colors (it already maps them via colors: { background: "hsl(var(--background))", ... }
github.com
, which we’ll keep updated). We’ll also extend the spacing in Tailwind config to introduce any needed token values (for example, define spacing scale steps that align with 8px increments). UI components and pages should be checked for inlined styles – replace any literal color codes or ad-hoc padding with tokenized classes (e.g. use className="p-6" where 6 corresponds to our spacing token, instead of a random value). Key components to review include buttons, cards, modals, and navigation (to apply the new colors and spacing uniformly).
Codex Best Practices: Introduce these theme changes in a controlled, reviewable manner. Use one commit to adjust the core theme variables and Tailwind config (e.g. “feat: update color tokens to new soft palette”), and separate commits for sweeping through components to apply them. Leverage descriptive PR titles like “UI refresh: soft color theme and spacing tokens”. Ensure all tests and lint checks pass; some tests might check class names or styles, so update snapshots if needed. It’s wise to do cross-browser and responsive testing after theme changes since colors and spacing affect layout – check that nothing overflows or becomes unreadable. Maintain modularity by using the design token approach – document these tokens (perhaps in the README or a design system doc) so future developers use them consistently. Lastly, verify dark mode still looks good with the new values (the dark theme variables should also be adjusted in tandem for consistency). Keeping both light and dark mode balanced is part of the polish (and note that dark mode is supported via design tokens per the project conventions
github.com
).
