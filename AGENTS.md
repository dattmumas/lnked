Task 8: UI/UX Enhancements – Accessibility & Polish
Goal: Refine the user interface for better accessibility and overall user experience. This includes adhering to accessibility standards (ARIA, keyboard navigation, contrast) and adding UI polish like loading states and responsive design improvements.
Scope & Actions:
Accessibility Audit & Fixes: Perform an audit (using tools like axe or manual testing) of the app’s accessibility. Ensure all interactive components have appropriate ARIA labels or roles. For example, verify modal dialogs from Radix have <DialogTitle> and <DialogDescription> as required (the design guidelines emphasize accessible dialogs

). Check that form inputs have associated <label> elements (e.g., the sign-in form, profile edit form). Many components already use Radix or proper semantics, but ensure no regressions. For instance, the follow/unfollow buttons and like buttons have aria-labels (as seen in PostReactionButtons
github.com
and CommentsSection
github.com
); double-check such labels make sense (e.g., “Like post” vs “Unlike post” dynamically).
Keyboard Navigation: Make sure all features can be used via keyboard alone. Test tabbing through the nav bar, forms, and editor. If any custom component (like a dropdown or sidebar menu) isn’t keyboard-accessible, use Radix primitives or add JavaScript to support arrow key navigation and focus trapping. For example, if there is a custom menu in the user profile or dashboard, ensure Tab and arrow keys navigate options, and pressing Esc closes the menu. This may involve adding role="menuitem" and handling keyDown events appropriately.
Responsive Design Tweaks: Review the layout on mobile and tablet sizes. Ensure that pages like the landing page (with components like AnimatedHero, SlideInCard, etc.) stack gracefully and remain readable on small screens. The design system specifies responsive behavior

, so verify components like the dashboard sidebar collapse on mobile or become accessible via a menu. If not already implemented, introduce a mobile navigation toggle for the dashboard menu and hide the sidebar by default on narrow screens to give content more space. Test the editor on mobile – if the sidebar (PostFormFields) and toolbar make the editor cramped on small screens, consider making the sidebar collapsible or scrollable horizontally.
Loading and Skeleton States: Enhance perceived performance by using skeletons and spinners. The project already includes skeleton components (e.g., skeleton.tsx in UI
github.com
and skeleton variants for dashboard cards
github.com
). Identify places where data is being loaded and a blank screen is shown. For instance, when the dashboard page first loads stats or posts, show skeleton cards for a brief moment instead of empty space. Likewise, when comments are loading on a post, there is a “Loading comments...” text
github.com
– consider using a nicer skeleton or at least a spinner icon alongside the text. Ensure every fetch has some user feedback: e.g., a disabled button with spinner for actions like “Posting comment…” or “Liking…”. This provides a smoother UX, especially on slower connections.
Visual Polish: Apply small improvements like consistent spacing and font sizes as per the design system. Use the 8px grid and predefined classes (e.g., standardize margins on section headings, ensure buttons use the design tokens for colors). Verify dark mode appearance for all new components; fix any color that doesn’t switch (utilize Tailwind’s dark: classes or CSS variables if needed). Also, add subtle animations where appropriate (the landing page already uses some fade-in; ensure new elements like alerts or modals also animate consistently, perhaps using the tailwindcss-animate utilities installed). These refinements make the app feel more professional and align with the stated design principles (minimalist, accessible, responsive)
