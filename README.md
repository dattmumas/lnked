- **Custom UI Only**: No third-party UI kits; all UI is custom and accessible.
- **Server-first**: Data fetching and auth via server components and API routes.
- **Accessibility**: All dialogs require a `DialogTitle`, all forms use labels, keyboard navigation is supported.
- **Editor Extensibility**: Add new blocks/nodes by creating a custom Lexical node and registering it in the editor.
