### Routing Updates

Collective pages now live under `/collectives/[slug]` instead of directly at the
root. User profiles are accessed at `/@username` (served by `/profile/[username]`).
Old ID-based paths like `/newsletters/[id]` or `/users/[id]` have been removed.
Account settings remain under `/dashboard/settings` and old URLs redirect automatically.
