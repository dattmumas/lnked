**Component**: Collective Profile Page Layout System
**Challenge**: Complex 40%/60% responsive grid with publication-style design
**Date**: 2025-01-06

## 🎯 PROBLEM STATEMENT

Design a sophisticated collective profile page layout that transforms a basic vertical feed into a publication-style hub with:
- Desktop (≥1024px): 40% left (brand showcase) / 60% right (content discovery)
- Tablet (768-1023px): Stacked sections with two-column content areas
- Mobile (≤767px): Single-column flow with horizontal scroll carousels

## 📐 LAYOUT OPTIONS ANALYSIS

### Option 1: CSS Grid Based Layout
**Description**: Pure CSS Grid implementation with grid-template-columns
**Pros**: Clean semantic structure, efficient rendering, Tailwind CSS integration
**Cons**: Complex responsive breakpoints, potential overflow issues
**Complexity**: Medium | **Implementation Time**: 2-3 hours

### Option 2: Flexbox Container System
**Description**: Nested flexbox containers with responsive flex-basis
**Pros**: Predictable responsive behavior, familiar patterns
**Cons**: Less semantic, complex nested structure
**Complexity**: Low-Medium | **Implementation Time**: 1-2 hours

### Option 3: Hybrid Grid + Component System
**Description**: CSS Grid for main layout, component-based responsive behavior
**Pros**: Combines grid power with component flexibility, semantic areas, perfect design system alignment
**Cons**: Complex initial setup, higher learning curve
**Complexity**: Medium-High | **Implementation Time**: 3-4 hours

## 🎯 DESIGN DECISION

**Selected Approach**: Option 3 - Hybrid Grid + Component System

**Rationale**: Best balance of semantic clarity, design system alignment, and responsive flexibility

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Base: CSS Grid with grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-[2fr_3fr] for 40%/60% split
- Responsive: Progressive enhancement from mobile-first single column
- Style Guide: Uses gap-6 (24px) and gap-8 (32px) spacing system
- Components: Semantic sections with CollectiveHero, AuthorCarousel, FeaturedMedia, ArticleList
