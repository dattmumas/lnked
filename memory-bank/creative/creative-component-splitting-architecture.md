### VideoPlayerPageClient Component (Current)

**Role:** Video page orchestration  
**Responsibilities:**

- Video metadata display (SEO opportunity)
- Mux player rendering (must remain client)
- User authentication state (can be server-side)
- Layout and styling (can be server-side)

**Key Interactions:**

- Comment posting → API calls → Database updates
- Reaction toggling → Optimistic UI → Database sync
- Video loading → Mux player → Playback controls
- User auth → Conditional rendering → Personalized content

---

## 🔄 ARCHITECTURE OPTIONS ANALYSIS

### Option 1: Hybrid Server/Client Architecture

**Description:** Split components into separate server and client parts with clear boundaries

**Architecture:**

```
CommentsSection (Server)
├── CommentsServer (RSC) - Static comment list, SEO-optimized
└── CommentsClient (Client) - Forms, reactions, interactions

VideoPlayerPage (Server)
├── VideoDetailsServer (RSC) - Title, description, metadata
└── VideoPlayerClient (Client) - Mux player, controls
```

**Pros:**

- ✅ Clear separation of concerns (static vs interactive)
- ✅ Optimal SEO for comment content and video metadata
- ✅ Faster initial page load with server-rendered content

Base Layer (Server)
├── CommentsServerPage (RSC) - Full comment display, forms
├── VideoServerPage (RSC) - Complete video page
└── Enhanced Layer (Client) - Interactive enhancements only
    ├── ReactionEnhancer (Client) - Adds optimistic updates
    ├── FormEnhancer (Client) - Adds real-time validation
    └── PlayerEnhancer (Client) - Adds advanced controls
```

**Pros:**

- ✅ Works without JavaScript (accessibility)
- ✅ Maximum server-side rendering benefits
- ✅ Graceful degradation for all users
- ✅ SEO optimized by default

**Cons:**

- ❌ Complex dual rendering logic
- ❌ Risk of maintaining two code paths

    style VPC fill:#ffa64d,stroke:#cc7a30,color:white
```

### Component Responsibilities:

**Server Components (RSC):**

- `CommentsServer`: Fetch and render initial comment list as static HTML
- `CommentsList`: Individual comment rendering with SEO-optimized markup
- `VideoDetailsServer`: Render video title, description, metadata as static HTML
- `VideoMetadata`: SEO-optimized video information and schema markup

**Client Components:**

- `CommentsClient`: Handle comment forms, reactions, real-time updates
- `ReactionButtons`: Optimistic UI for like/dislike interactions
- `VideoPlayerClient`: Mux player integration and video controls
- `CommentForm`: User input handling and submission

### Data Flow Strategy:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Browser
    participant ServerComponent
    participant ClientComponent
    participant API
    participant Database

    Browser->>ServerComponent: Initial request
    ServerComponent->>Database: Fetch initial data
    Database-->>ServerComponent: Return data
    ServerComponent-->>Browser: Static HTML + Client components
    Browser->>ClientComponent: Hydrate interactive parts
    ClientComponent->>API: User interactions
    API->>Database: Update data
    Database-->>API: Confirm update
    API-->>ClientComponent: Return new state
    ClientComponent-->>Browser: Update UI
```

### Implementation Guidelines:

1. **Server Component Pattern:**

   ```tsx
   // CommentsServer.tsx (RSC)
   export default async function CommentsServer({ postId }: Props) {
     const comments = await fetchComments(postId);
     return (
       <section>
         <CommentsList comments={comments} />
         <CommentsClient postId={postId} />
       </section>
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Client Component Pattern:**

   ```tsx
   // CommentsClient.tsx
   'use client';
   export default function CommentsClient({ postId }: Props) {
     return (
       <>
         <CommentForm postId={postId} />
         <ReactionButtons postId={postId} />
       </>
     );
   }
   ```

3. **Authentication Handling:**

   - Server components: Use `createServerSupabaseClient()` for user context
   - Client components: Use `createSupabaseBrowserClient()` for interactions
   - Pass user state from server to client via props

4. **State Management:**
   - Server: Initial data fetch and static rendering
   - Client: Optimistic updates and real-time interactions
   - Sync: Client-side mutations trigger revalidation
