**Task ID**: VIDEO-002  
**Task Level**: Level 3 â€“ Intermediate Feature  
**Start Date**: 2025-01-06  
**Build Completion**: 2025-01-06  
**Reflection Date**: 2025-01-06

## 1. Implementation Review

### What was delivered?

1. **Video schema alignment** across API, DB, and UI (`video_assets` migration, Zod schema, RLS policies).
2. **MUX best-practice integration** â€“ direct SDK usage, robust webhook with signature verification, error/fallback handling, and detailed logging.
3. **Route consolidation** â€“ all video pages unified under `/videos` with client & server components updated.
4. **Navigation redesign** â€“ hierarchical sidebar with collectives submenu, dual action buttons, full ARIA support.

### Verification

- TypeScript compilation â€“ 0 video-related errors.
- Supabase migration â€“ columns + constraints verified; RLS policies adjusted.
- Manual upload tests â€“ asset â†’ ready flow completes, playback ID stored, video plays.
- Webhook tests â€“ enhanced logs confirm signature check, DB updates, error branches.

## 2. Successes ðŸŽ‰

1. **First-try schema migration** â€“ adopted progressive approach â†’ zero downtime.
2. **Webhook resilience** â€“ fallback logic eliminated "waiting for playback ID" bug.
3. **Accessibility wins** â€“ sidebar fully keyboard & screen-reader navigable.
4. **Developer DX** â€“ exhaustive console logging greatly accelerated debugging.

## 3. Challenges ðŸ˜…

| Area                       | Challenge                           | Resolution                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| DB Types                   | Missing tables/enums broke type-gen | Linked to remote DB â†’ regenerated types (95.5 % error drop) |
| Large video file in repo   | 192 MB commit blocked push          | Reset commits, purge file, `.gitignore` update              |
| Playback ID race-condition | asset.ready before asset_created    | Introduced dual-key update (asset_id â†’ upload_id) fallback  |
| Ngrok confusion            | Unsure if tunnel needed             | Clarified webhook vs polling responsibilities               |

## 4. Lessons Learned ðŸ’¡

1. **Add row-count checks** for every DB update â€“ prevents silent failures.
2. **Verbose, color-coded logs** drastically cut debugging time; keep as pattern.
3. **Progressive migration** (nullable âžœ populate âžœ not-null) is safest path even for mid-sized teams.
4. **Avoid committing binaries**; enforce Git LFS or CI size checks early.

## 5. Opportunities for Improvement ðŸ“ˆ

1. **Automated webhook replay** tool for local dev to remove ngrok need.
2. **E2E tests** covering full upload â†’ ready playback path (Playwright + Mux test env).
3. **Refactor polling** interval to exponential back-off to reduce API calls.
4. **Storybook docs** for new Sidebar & Wizard components to aid design team.

## 6. Action Items & Follow-ups

- [ ] Add Playwright script simulating upload & ready cycle with mocked webhooks.
- [ ] Introduce husky pre-push hook to detect >50 MB files.
- [ ] Schedule performance audit of `/videos` route after new components settle.
