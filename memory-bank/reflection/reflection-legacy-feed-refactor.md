# Reflection: Legacy Feed Refactor & Video Post Integration

## Review & Comparison to Plan

- Unified feed UI using PostCard/VideoCard components.
- Design system tokens applied throughout.
- In-feed video playback enabled.
- Chain feed and navigation preserved.
- Video upload → post creation flow clarified.

## Successes

- Unified, maintainable card system for all post types.
- Full design system compliance.
- In-feed video playback with Mux HLS.
- Accessibility improvements (play button, ARIA labels).
- Performance and maintainability gains.

## Challenges

- Refactoring large, monolithic legacy code.
- Ensuring robust Mux playback across browsers.
- Video upload did not auto-create posts, causing confusion.
- Occasional Next.js build/cache issues.

## Lessons Learned

- Decoupling asset creation from post publishing is flexible but must be clear in UX.
- Webhook-based post creation can be fragile; explicit publish actions are clearer.
- Upfront design system migration prevents future debt.
- End-to-end tests for upload → post → feed are essential.

## Improvements

- Consider auto-creating posts on upload or asset ready.
- Optionally use Mux Player React for best compatibility.
- Add global video playback control (one at a time).
- Clarify video publishing workflow in UI.

## Status

- Reflection complete. Ready for archiving.
