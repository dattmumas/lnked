# üì¶ ARCHIVE: EDITOR-001 POST EDITOR ISSUES

**Task ID**: EDITOR-001  
**Complexity Level**: Level 2 - Simple Enhancement  
**Type**: Bug Fix & UI Enhancement  
**Date**: 2025-01-06  
**Status**: üöß PARTIALLY COMPLETED - ARCHIVED  
**Archive Date**: 2025-01-06

## üéØ ORIGINAL OBJECTIVE

Fix critical editor issues affecting user experience in the post creation and editing workflow.

**Original Issues Identified:**

1. **Critical**: Editor exiting canvas after each keystroke
2. **High**: Subtitle line disappeared from forms
3. **Medium**: Style not aligned with style guide
4. **Medium**: Toolbar overflowing, tools inaccessible on mobile

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED WORK

### Phase 1: Focus Management Fix - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Issue**: Editor losing focus after each keystroke causing cursor to jump out of editor canvas

**Root Cause**: `OnChangePlugin` in `LexicalPlaygroundEditorInternal.tsx` creating new function references on every render, causing unnecessary re-renders and focus loss.

**Solution Implemented**:

- ‚úÖ Added `useCallback` and `useRef` imports
- ‚úÖ Implemented debounced onChange handler with 100ms timeout
- ‚úÖ Replaced problematic `OnChangePlugin` usage with stable reference
- ‚úÖ Used `useRef` to avoid stale closures
- ‚úÖ Created backup of original file before changes

**Technical Details**:

```typescript
// Fixed implementation in LexicalPlaygroundEditorInternal.tsx
const debouncedOnChange = useCallback(
  debounce((editorState: EditorState) => {
    if (onChangeRef.current) {
      onChangeRef.current(editorState);
    }
  }, 100),
  [],
);
```

**Verification**: ‚úÖ Editor now maintains focus during typing, no cursor jumping

## üöß INCOMPLETE WORK

### Phase 2: Subtitle Restoration - ‚ùå NOT STARTED

**Issue**: Subtitle input fields missing from post creation/edit forms

**Analysis Completed**:

- Identified missing subtitle input in `/posts/new/page.tsx`
- Need to add subtitle field between title and editor
- Should match existing form patterns

### Phase 3: Style Guide Alignment - ‚ùå NOT STARTED

**Issue**: Editor styling inconsistent with design system

**Scope**:

- `Toolbar.css` has hardcoded colors instead of CSS variables
- Aggressive responsive hiding on mobile
- Inconsistent spacing and typography

### Phase 4: Toolbar Overflow Resolution - ‚ùå NOT STARTED

**Issue**: Toolbar tools become inaccessible on mobile devices

**Scope**:

- Implement horizontal scrolling for toolbar
- Add visual indicators for hidden tools
- Improve touch targets for mobile

## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `src/components/editor/LexicalPlaygroundEditorInternal.tsx` - Focus fix applied
- ‚úÖ Created backup: `src/components/editor/LexicalPlaygroundEditorInternal.tsx.backup`

### Files Identified for Future Work

- ‚ùå `src/app/posts/new/page.tsx` - Needs subtitle input
- ‚ùå `src/app/posts/[slug]/edit/page.tsx` - Needs subtitle input
- ‚ùå `src/components/editor/Toolbar.css` - Needs style updates
- ‚ùå `src/components/editor/ui/toolbar/ToolbarPlugin.tsx` - Needs overflow handling

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, TypeScript
- **Editor**: Lexical (Facebook's rich text editor)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + custom CSS modules
- **State Management**: React hooks, useCallback, useRef

## üìä IMPACT ASSESSMENT

### ‚úÖ Positive Impact Achieved

- **Critical Fix**: Editor focus issue resolved - users can now type continuously without interruption
- **Developer Experience**: Stable editor behavior improves development workflow
- **User Experience**: Typing experience significantly improved

### ‚ùå Remaining Technical Debt

- **Missing Features**: Subtitle inputs not restored
- **Inconsistent Styling**: Editor doesn't match design system
- **Mobile UX**: Toolbar still problematic on mobile devices
- **Accessibility**: Potential issues with toolbar navigation

## üéì LESSONS LEARNED

### Technical Insights

1. **React Rendering**: Function reference stability critical for complex components
2. **Debouncing**: 100ms debounce provides good balance of responsiveness vs. performance
3. **useCallback Patterns**: Essential for preventing cascade re-renders in editor components
4. **Lexical Editor**: OnChangePlugin requires careful implementation to avoid focus issues

### Process Insights

1. **Incremental Fixes**: Addressing critical issues first allows for immediate value delivery
2. **Backup Strategy**: Creating backups before complex changes proved valuable
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Time spent identifying OnChangePlugin issue was well invested
4. **Verification**: Testing fix immediately confirmed solution effectiveness

### Future Considerations

1. **Complete Implementation**: Remaining phases should be completed for full user experience
2. **Mobile-First**: Toolbar overflow should be priority for mobile user experience
3. **Design System**: Style guide alignment improves overall product consistency
4. **Testing**: Editor changes require thorough cross-browser and device testing

## üîÆ RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE WORK

### Immediate Priority (if resumed)

1. **Subtitle Restoration**: Low-complexity addition with high user value
2. **Mobile Toolbar**: High impact for mobile users

### Medium Priority

1. **Style Guide Alignment**: Improves overall design consistency
2. **Accessibility Audit**: Ensure editor meets WCAG 2.2 standards

### Long-term Considerations

1. **Editor Architecture**: Consider moving to newer Lexical patterns
2. **Performance**: Implement virtualization for large documents
3. **Collaborative Editing**: Future feature consideration

## üìã HANDOFF NOTES

### For Developer Continuation

- Focus fix implementation in `LexicalPlaygroundEditorInternal.tsx` is stable
- Backup file available for reference: `.tsx.backup`
- Remaining subtitle work is straightforward form enhancement
- Toolbar CSS needs CSS variable migration for design system compliance

### Code Quality Status

- ‚úÖ TypeScript: No type errors in modified files
- ‚úÖ ESLint: No linting errors in focus fix
- ‚úÖ Functionality: Editor focus behavior verified working
- ‚ùå Complete Feature: Only 1 of 4 issues resolved
