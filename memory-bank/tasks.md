The homepage is split into three main areas across the screen, arranged horizontally:

1. Left Sidebar – Navigation Drawer
   This is a slim vertical bar fixed to the left side of the screen. Its primary role is to help users navigate the app.

Default State: It shows just icons stacked vertically (like Home, Explore, Subscriptions, Profile, Settings).

Expanded State: When hovered (on desktop) or tapped (on mobile/tablet), it slides out to reveal full labels next to each icon ("Home", "Explore", etc.).

Positioning & Behavior:

It's always fixed in place — doesn't scroll with the page.

On smaller screens, it becomes a button in the navbar or transforms into a bottom nav.

Styling: Matches the site's dark/light theme. Slightly transparent background (e.g., glassy blur), rounded icons, and subtle hover effects.

Think of this like Twitter's or Notion's left rail — unobtrusive but easily expandable.

2. Center Feed – Unified Content Stream
   This is the main column that fills most of the screen and is where users will spend the majority of their time.

Purpose: A single, chronological stream of all content types: posts and videos.

Content Types:

Posts look like modern newsletter entries — text, metadata, maybe a thumbnail.

Videos resemble vertical or horizontal video cards — auto-play preview on hover, maybe captions or duration.

Order: Everything is shown in order of publication time, regardless of type. A post published 2 hours ago will appear above a video published 4 hours ago.

Behavior:

Users can scroll indefinitely — content loads in chunks ("infinite scroll").

Optionally: content can be filtered with toggle buttons (e.g., "All", "Posts", "Videos", "Collectives").

Interaction: Each post/video has buttons for like, comment, bookmark, share — consistent with platform norms.

Responsiveness: On smaller screens, this column becomes the full-width main feed.

This is your "home timeline" — everything you're following, all in one scroll.

3. Right Sidebar – Activity Feed ("Chains")
   This is a narrow vertical strip on the right, visible on desktop and large tablets. It shows a compact social activity feed — think Twitter or Threads.

What It Shows: Quick, punchy updates (tweets, replies, reshared content) from the users you follow.

Content Style:

Each entry is compact: username, timestamp, short content snippet, maybe a small media preview.

Looks like Twitter's feed — profile pic, name, body text, subtle dividers between posts.

Behavior:

Scrolls independently of the main feed — so users can browse Chains while reading posts.

New Chains can be loaded in batches or streamed live.

Styling:

Slightly darkened background or subtle border to distinguish it from the center feed.

Optional title like "Followed Activity" or just show the stream immediately.

Mobile Behavior: This sidebar disappears entirely on smaller screens. It may become a toggleable drawer or be integrated elsewhere.

This is your real-time pulse of what's happening — like "what's trending in your circle."

🔄 How It All Works Together
The top navbar stays visible across all pages. It contains global elements like the logo, search bar, new content button, and user avatar menu.

The left and right sidebars are visually light, so they don't distract from the main feed. But they're fully interactive — hover, expand, click, scroll.

The entire page is responsively adaptive:

On large screens: all three columns are visible.

On medium screens: left stays collapsed, right disappears.

On small screens: only the center feed shows; the left nav collapses into a bottom or drawer nav.
